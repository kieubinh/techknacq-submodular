        "We present an algorithm for bilingual word alignment that extends previous work by treating multi-word candidates on a par with single words, and combining some simple assumptions about the translation process to capture alignments for low frequency words.",
        "As most other alignment algorithms it uses co-occurrence statistics as a basis, but differs in the assumptions it makes about the translation process.",
        "The algorithm has been implemented in a modular system that allows the user to experiment with different combinations and variants of these assumptions.",
        "We give performance results from two evaluations, which compare well with results reported in the literature."

      "text": [
        "In recent years much progress have been made in the area of bilingual alignment for the support of tasks such as machine translation, machine-aided translation, bilingual lexicography and terminology.",
        "For instance, Melamed (1997a) reports that his word-to-word model for translational equivalence produced lexicon entries with 99% precision and 46% recall when trained on 13 million words of the Hansard corpus, where recall was measured as the fraction of words from the bitext that were assigned some translation.",
        "Using the same model but less data, a French/English software manual of 400,000 words, Resnik and Melamed (1997) reported 94% precision with 30% recall.",
        "While these figures are indeed impressive, more telling figures can only be obtained by measuring the effect of the alignment system on some specific task.",
        "Dagan and Church (1994) reports that their Termight system helped double the speed at which terminology lists could be compiled at the AT&T Business Translation Services.",
        "It is also clear that the usability of bilingual concordances would be greatly improved if the system could indicate both items of a translation pair and if phrases could be looked up with the same ease and precision as single words (Macklovitch and Hannan 1996).",
        "For the language pairs that are of particular interest to us, English vs. other Germanic languages, the ability to handle multi-word units adequately is crucial (cf. Jones and Alexa 1997).",
        "In English a large number of technical terms are multi-word compounds, while the corresponding terms in other Germanic languages are often single-word compounds.",
        "We illustrate with a few examples from an English/Swedish computer manual:",
        "English Swedish file manager filhanterare network server natverksserver operating system operativsystem setup directory installationskatalog Also, many common adverbials and prepositions are multi-word units, which may or may not be translated as such.",

      "heading": "1. The Problem",
      "text": [
        "The problem we consider is how to find word and phrase alignments for a bitext that is already aligned at the sentence level.",
        "Results should be delivered in a form that could easily be checked and corrected by a human user.",
        "Although we primarily use the system for",
        "bitexts with an English and a Scandinavian half, the system should preferably be useful for many different language pairs.",
        "Thus we don't rely on the existence of POS-taggers or lemmatizers for the languages involved, but wish to provide mechanisms that a user can easily adapt to new languages.",
        "The organisation of the paper is as follows: In section 2 we relate this approach to previous work, in section 3 we motivate and spell out our assumptions about the behaviour of lexical units in translation, in section 4 we present the basic features of the algorithm, and in section 5 we present results from an evaluation and try to compare these to the results of others."

      "heading": "2. Previous work",
      "text": [
        "Most algorithms for bilingual word alignment to date have been based on the probabilistic translation models first proposed by Brown et al.",
        "(1988, 1990), especially Model 1 and Model 2.",
        "These models explicitly exclude multi-word units from consideration.",
        "Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multi-word compounds in bitexts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model.",
        "A trial translation model that treat certain multi-word sequences as units is compared with a base translation model that treats the same sequences as multiple single-word units.",
        "A drawback with Melamed's method is that compounds are defined relative to a given translation and not with respect to language-internal criteria.",
        "Thus, if the method is used to construct a bilingual concordance, there is a risk that compounds and idioms that translate compositionally will not be found.",
        "Moreover, it is computationally expensive and, since it constructs compounds incrementally, adding one word at a time, requires many iterations and much processing to find linguistic units of the proper size.",
        "Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996) present results from aligning multi-word and single word expressions with a recall of 80 per cent if partially correct translations were included.",
        "Their method is iterative and is based on the use of the Dice coefficient.",
        "Smadja et.",
        "al (1996) also use the Dice I Model 3-5 includes multi-word units in one direction.",
        "coefficient as their basis for aligning collocations between English and French.",
        "Their evaluation show results of 73 per cent accuracy (precision) on average."

      "heading": "3. Underlying assumptions",
      "text": [
        "As Fung and Church (1994) we wish to estimate the bilingual lexicon directly.",
        "Unlike Fung and Church our texts are already aligned at sentence level and the lexicon is viewed, not merely as word associations, but as associations between lexical units of the two languages.",
        "We assume that texts have structure at many different levels.",
        "At the most concrete level a text is simply a sequence of characters.",
        "At the next level a text is a sequence of word tokens, where word tokens are defined as sequences of alphanumeric character strings that are separated from one another by a finite set of delimiters such as spaces and punctuation marks.",
        "While many characters can be used either as word delimiters or as non-delimiters, we prefer to uphold a consistent difference between delimiters and non-delimiters, for the ease of implementation that it allows.",
        "At the same time, however, the tokenizer recognizes common abbreviations with internal punctuation marks and regularizes clitics to words (e.g. can't is regularized to can not).",
        "At the next level up a text can be viewed as a partially ordered bag of lexical units.",
        "It is a bag because the same unit can occur several times in a single sentence.",
        "It is partially ordered because a lexical unit may extend across other lexical units, as in He turned the offer down.",
        "Tabs were kept on him.",
        "We say that words express lexical units, and that units are expressed by words.",
        "A unit may be expressed by a multi-word sequence, while a given word can express at most one lexical unit.2 It is often hard to tell the difference between a lexical unit and a lexical complex.",
        "We assume that 2 This latter assumption is actually too strict for Germanic languages where morphological compounding is a productive process, but we make it nevertheless, as we have no means too identify compounds reliably.",
        "Moreover, the borderline between a lexicalized compound and a compositional compound is hard to draw consistently, anyway.",
        "recurrent collocations that pass certain structural and contextual tests are candidate expressions for lexical units.",
        "If such collocations are found to correspond to something in the other half of the bitext on the basis of co-occurrence measures, they are regarded as expressions of lexical units.",
        "This will include compound names such as New York', Henry Kissinger' and World War II', and compound terms such as 'network server directory'.",
        "Thus, as with the compositional compounds just discussed, we prefer high recall to high precision in identifying multi-word units.",
        "The expressions of a lexical unit form an equivalence class.",
        "An equivalence class for a single-word unit includes its morphological variants.",
        "An equivalence class for a multi-word unit should include syntactic variants as well.",
        "For instance, the lexical unit turn_down should include 'turned down' 'turning down' as well as expressions where the particle is separated from the verb by some appropriate phrase, as in the example above.",
        "The current system, though, does not provide for syntactic variants.",
        "Our aim is to establish relations not only between corresponding words and word sequences in the bitext, but also between corresponding lexical units.",
        "A problem is then that the algorithm cannot recognize lexical units directly, but only their expressions.",
        "It helps to include lexical units in the underlying model, however, as they have explanatory value.",
        "Moreover, the algorithm can be made to deliver its output in the form of correspondences between equivalence classes of expressions belonging to the same lexical unit.",
        "For the purpose of generating the alignment and the dictionary we divide the lexical units into three classes:",
        "1. irrelevant units, 2. closed class units, 3. open class units",
        "The same categories apply to expressions.",
        "Irrelevant units are simply those that we don't want to include.",
        "They have to be listed explicitly.",
        "The reason for not including some items may vary with the purpose of alignment.",
        "Even if we wish the alignment to be as complete as possible, it might be useful to exclude certain units that we suspect may confuse the algorithm.",
        "For instance, the do-support found in English usually has no counterpart in other languages.",
        "Thus, the different forms of 'do' may be excluded from consideration from the start.",
        "As for the translation relation we make the following assumptions:",
        "1.",
        "A lexical unit in one half of the bitext corresponds to at most one lexical unit in the other half.",
        "This can be seen as a generalization of the one-to-one assumption for word-to-word translation used by Melamed (1997a) and is exploited for the same purpose, i.e. to exclude large numbers of candidate alignments, when good initial alignments have been found.",
        "2.",
        "Open class and closed class lexical units are usually translated and there are a limited number of lexical units in the other language that are commonly used to translate them.",
        "While deliberately vague this assumption is what motivates our search for frequent pairs <source expression, target expression> with high mutual information.",
        "It also motivates our choice of regarding additions and deletions of lexical units in translation as haphazard apart from the case of a restricted set of irrelevant units that we assume can be known in advance.",
        "3.",
        "Open class units can only be aligned with open class units, and closed class units can only be aligned with closed class units.",
        "This assumption seems generally correct and has the effect of reducing the number of candidate alignments significantly.",
        "Closed class units have to be listed explicitly.",
        "The assumption is that we know the two languages sufficiently well to be able to come up with an appropriate list of closed class units and expressions.",
        "Multi-word closed class units are listed separately.",
        "Closed class units can be further classified for the purposes of alignment (see below).",
        "4.",
        "If some expression for the lexical unit Us is found corresponding to some expression for the lexical unit UT, then assume that any expression of Us may correspond to any expression of UT.",
        "This assumption is in accordance with the often made observation that morphological properties are not invariants in translation.",
        "It is used to make the algorithm more greedy by accepting infrequent alignments that are morphological variants of high-rating ones.",
        "5.",
        "If one half of an aligned sentence pair is the expression of a single lexical unit, then assume that the other half is also.",
        "This is definitely a heuristic, but it has been shown to be very useful",
        "for technical texts involving English and Scandinavian, where terms are often found in lists or table cells (Tiedemann 1997).",
        "This heuristic is useful for finding alignments regardless of frequencies.",
        "Similarly, if there is only one non-aligned (relevant open class) word left in a partially aligned sentence, assume that it corresponds to the remaining (relevant open class) words of the corresponding sentence.",
        "6.",
        "Position matters, i.e. while word order is not an invariant of translation it is not random either.",
        "We implement the contribution of position as a distribution of weights over the candidate pairs of expressions drawn from a given pair of sentences.",
        "Expressions that are close in relative position receive higher weights, while expressions that are far from each other receive lower weights."
