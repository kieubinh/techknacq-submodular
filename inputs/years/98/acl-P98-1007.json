        "The work reported in this paper aims at determining which constraints hold on the interaction between the expression of causality (with or without connective) and aspectual properties of the eventualities and of the tenses used to express them.",
        "As a matter of fact, it turns out that, at least in French, the choice of one of the two tenses passe simple (Ps) or imparfait (IMP) is not neutral with respect to the expression of causality, in particular realised by means of the connective \"donc\" (therefore).",
        "It has been observed that even when concerned only with temporal localisation, it is not enough to characterize tenses if one do not take into account the effects of discourse relations between eventualities': (la-b) (Molendijk, 1996); it has also been observed that the use of the 'We use the term eventuality to refer to either events, states or processes, as is traditional since (Bach, 1981).",

        "As a matter of fact, the choice of an appropriate form to express a cause relation between events has proved a non trivial problem (Danlos, 1987; Danlos, 1998).",
        "Two parameters have been identified as playing an important role: first, the order of presentation (cause before consequence, or the contrary), and second,",
        "the presence (or absence) of a connective3.",
        "The examples we deal with in this paper suggest that tenses, at least in French and in particular the choice between PS and IMP must also be taken into account.",
        "The assumptions we make for this work are the following.",
        "We assume the view on discourse adopted within the SRDT framework (Asher, 1993): in a coherent discourse, sentences are linked by discourse relations, which help finding anaphor antecedents, computing temporal localisations, etc.",
        "Here, we are concerned only with two discourse relations, both involving causality.",
        "We call the first one result, as in (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), it holds between two sentences when the main eventuality of the first one is the cause of the main eventuality of the second one.",
        "We assume here a very open notion of causality that we don't want to refine.4 We call the other one explanation, it holds between two sentences when the cause is presented after its consequence, thus playing an explanation role for the first sentence.",
        "This configuration in interaction with \"donc\" has been studied in (Rossari and Jayez, 1997) where it is called \"causal ab-duction\".",
        "We adopt as a basis for the description of IMP the proposal made in the DRT framework (Ramp and Rohrer, 1983; Ramp and Reyle, 1993), amended with proposals made in French literature, in particular concerning the anaphoric properties of this tense (Tasmowski-De Ryck, 1985; Vet and Molendijk, 1985; Molendijk, 1994).",
        "At last, we adopt the description of the connective \"donc\" which is elaborated, in terms of conditions of use and semantic effects, in (Jayez and Rossari, 1998).",
        "We start by considering discourses where a cause is presented after its consequence (i.e., an explanation discourse relation should hold).",
        "We observe that a PS-IMP sequence is sufficient to achieve the explanation effect, but that this sequence is constrained by the type of causality 3(Danlos, 1988) shows the influence of many others parameters, like the voice active vs. passive, the presence of a relative clause, etc.",

        "We also notice that connectives do not seem to interfere with tenses in this case (§ 2).",
        "We then examine discourses where the cause is presented before the consequence.",
        "In the absence of connective, we observe that none of the acceptable forms automatically convey causality (§ 3.1).",
        "With the connective \"donc\", causality is imposed by the connective, but in its turn it brings new constraints (§ 3.2).",
