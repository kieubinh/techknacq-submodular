        "Given the goal of machine-generated summaries, these approaches attempt to answer three central questions:",
        "• How does the system count words to calculate worthiness for summarization?",

        "• How does the system create a coherent and cohesive summary?",
        "Our work leverages off of research in these three approaches and attempts to remedy some of the difficulties encountered in each by applying a combination of information retrieval, information extraction, We would like to thank Jamie Callan for his help with the INQUERY experiments.",

        "Our approach, similar to (Tzoukerman, Klavans, and Jacquemin, 1997), is to apply NLP tools to extract multi-word phrases automatically with high accuracy and use them as the basic unit in the summarization process, including frequency calculation.",
        "Our system uses both text statistics (term frequency, or if) and corpus statistics (inverse document frequency, or idf) (Salton and McGill, 1983) to derive signature words as one of the summarization features.",
