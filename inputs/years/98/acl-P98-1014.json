        "It is a remarkable fact that humans can often understand sentences containing unknown words, infer their grammatical properties and incrementally refine hypotheses about these words when encountering later instances.",
        "In contrast, many current NLP systems still presuppose a complete lexicon.",
        "Notable exceptions include Zernik (1989), Erbach (1990), Hastings & Lytinen (1994).",
        "See Zernik for an introduction to the general issues involved.",
        "This paper describes an HPSG-based system which can incrementally learn and refine properties of unknown words after parsing individual sentences.",
        "It focusses on extracting linguistic properties, as compared to e.g. general concept learning (Hahn, Klenner & Schnattinger 1996).",
        "Unlike Erbach (1990), however, it is not confined to simple morpho-syntactic information but can also handle selectional restrictions, semantic types and argument structure.",
        "Finally, while statistical approaches like Brent (1991) can gather e.g. valence information from large corpora, we are more interested in full grammatical processing of individual sentences to maximally exploit each context.",
        "The following three goals serve to structure our model.",
        "It should i) incorporate a gradual, information-based conceptualization of \"unknownness\".",
        "Words are not unknown as a whole, but may contain unknown, i.e. revisable pieces of information.",
        "Consequently, even known words can undergo revision to es.. acquire new senses.",
        "This view replaces the binary distinction between open and closed class words.",
        "It should ii) maximally exploit the rich representations and modelling conventions of HPSG and associated formalisms, with essentially the same grammar and lexicon as compared to closed-lexicon approaches.",
        "This is important both to facilitate reuse of existing grammars and to enable meaningful feedback for linguistic theorizing..",
        "Finally, it should iii) possess domain-independent inference and lexicon-updating capabilities.",
        "The grammar writer must be able to fully declare which pieces of information are open to revision.",
        "The system was implemented using MicroCUF, a simplified version of the CUF typed unification formalism (Mae & Dorna 1993) that we implemented in SICStus Prolog.",
        "It shares both the feature logic and the definite clause extensions with its big brother, but substitutes a closed-world type system for CUF's open-world regime.",
        "A feature of our type system implementation that will be significant later on is that type information in internal feature structures (FSs) can be easily updated.",
        "The HPSG grammar developed with MicroCUF models a fragment of German.",
        "Since our focus is on the lexicon, the range of syntactic variation treated is currently limited to simplex sentences with canonical word order.",
        "We have incorporated some recent developments of HPSG, esp.",
        "the revisions of Pollard & Sag (1994, ch.",
        "9), Manning & Sag (1995)'s proposal for an independent level of argument structure and Bouma (1997)'s use of argument structure to eliminate procedural lexical rules in favour of relational constraints.",
        "Our elaborate ontology of semantic types – useful for non-trivial acquisition of selectional restrictions and nominal sorts – was derived from a systematic corpus study of a biological domain (Knodel 1980, 154-188).",
        "The grammar also covers all valence classes encountered in the corpus.",
        "As for the lexicon format, we currently list full forms only.",
        "Clearly, a morphology component would supply more contextual information from known affixes but would still require the processing of unknown stems."

        "Generalizable information exhibits another peculiarity: we need a disjoint auxiliary type u_g to correctly mark the initial unknown information state.3 This is because 'content' types like prd, pred, attr are to be interpreted as recording what contextual information was encountered in the past.",
        "Thus, using any of these to prespecify the initial value – either as the side-effect of a feature appropriateness declaration (e.g. prd) or through grammar-controlled specification (e.g. pred, attr) – would be wrong (cf. prd initial v attr = prd, but V attr = u_g V attr).",
        "Generalizable information evokes another question: can we simply have types like those in fig. 1 within HPSG signs and do in-place type union, just like type unification?",
        "The answer is no, for essentially two reasons.",
        "First, we still want to rule out ungrammatical constructions through (type) unification failure of coindexed values, so that generalizable types cannot always be combined by nonfailing type union (e.g. *der sensible Geruch 'the sensitive smell' must be ruled out via sense _or g an A smell = _L).",
        "We would ideally like to order all type unifications pertaining to a value before all unions, but this violates the order independence of constraint solving.",
        "Secondly, we already know that a given informational token can simultaneously be generalizable and specializable, e.g. by being coindexed through HPSG's valence principle.",
        "However, simultaneous in-place union and unification is contradictory.",
        "To avoid these problems and keep the declarative monotonic setting, we employ two independent features gen and ctxt.",

        "Of course there are areas requiring further consideration.",
