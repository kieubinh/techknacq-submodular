        "Semantic relationships among words and phrases are often marked by explicit syntactic or lexical clues that help recognize such relationships in texts.",
        "Within complex nominals, however, few overt clues are available.",
        "Systems that analyze such nominals must compensate for the lack of surface clues with other information.",
        "One way is to load the system with lexical semantics for nouns or adjectives.",
        "This merely shifts the problem elsewhere: how do we define the lexical semantics and build large semantic lexicons?",
        "Another way is to find constructions similar to a given complex nominal, for which the relationships are already known.",
        "This is the way we chose, but it too has drawbacks.",
        "Similarity is not easily assessed, similar analyzed constructions may not exist, and if they do exist, their analysis may not be appropriate for the current nominal.",
        "We present a semi-automatic system that identifies semantic relationships in noun phrases without using precoded noun or adjective semantics.",
        "Instead, partial matching on previously analyzed noun phrases leads to a tentative interpretation of a new input.",
        "Processing can start without prior analyses, but the early stage requires user interaction.",
        "As more noun phrases are analyzed, the system learns to find better interpretations and reduces its reliance on the user.",
        "In experiments on English technical texts the system correctly identified 60-70% of relationships automatically."

        "We have built a system for noun modifier relationship (NMR) analysis that assigns semantic relationships in complex noun phrases.",
