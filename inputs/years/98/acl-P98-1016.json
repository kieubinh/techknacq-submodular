        "For the present discussion we assume that two concepts are compatible if they share a semantically significant common super-type, or if one concept is a supertype of the other.",
        "In Result 3.1, the concept [send] is present twice, and also the concept [letter] is present in two compatible forms: [letter] and [message].",
        "The compatibility comes from the presence in the type hierarchy4 of one sense of [letter], [letter_2], as being a subtype of [message].",
        "These compatible forms actually allow the disambiguation of concept [letter] into [letter_2].",

        "Both (agent) relations attached to concept [send] lead to compatible concepts: [they] and [person].",
        "We can therefore go back to the graph definition of [stamp] in which the pronoun [they] could have referred to the concepts [letters], [packages], [people] or [stamps], and now disambiguate it to [people].",

        "A relation hierarchy, as presented in (Sowa, 1984), is simply a way to establish an order between the possible relations.",
        "The idea is to include relations that correspond to the English prepositions (it could be the prepositions of any language studied) at the top of the hierarchy, and consider them generalizations of possible deeper semantic relations.",
        "This relation hierarchy is important for the comparison of graphs expressing similar ideas but using different sentence patterns that are reflected in the graphs by different prepositions becoming relations.",
        "Let us look in Figure 1 at Definition 3.3 which gives a sentence in the definition of [card_2] and Result 3.4 which gives the maximal join with graph maiLl/stamp from result 3.3 around concept [mail_1].",
        "Subgraphs [send]->(in)->[mail_1] and [send]->(through)->tmaiLl] have compatible concepts on both sides of two different relations.",
        "These two prepositions are both supertypes of a restricted set of semantic relations.",
        "On Figure 2 which shows a small part of the relation hierarchy, we highlighted the compatibility between through and in.",
        "It shows that the two prepositions interact at manner (at location as well but more indirectly).",
        "Therefore, we can establish the similarity of those two relations via the manner relation, and the ambiguity is resolved as shown in Result 3.5.",
        "Note that the concept [person] is present many time among the different graphs in Figure 1.",
        "This gives the reader an insight into the complexity behind clustering.",
        "It all relies on compatibility of concepts and relations.",
        "Compatibility of concepts alone might be sufficient if the concepts are highly semantically significant, but for general concepts like [person], [place], [animal] we cannot assume so.",
        "In the graph presented in Result 3.5, there are buyers of stamps, receivers and senders of letters and they are all people, but not necessarily the same ones.",
