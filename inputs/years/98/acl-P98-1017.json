        "In this paper we present core aspects of the multilingual natural language generation component VM-GECO1 that has been integrated into the research prototype of Verbmobil (Wahlster, 1993; Bub et al., 1997), a system for spontaneous speech – to – speech dialog translation.",
        "In order to achieve multilinguality as elegantly as possible we found that a clear modular separation between a language – independent general kernel generator and language – specific parts which consist of syntactic and lexical knowledge sources was a very promising approach.",
        "Accordingly, our generation component",
        "consists of one kernel generator and language – specific knowledge sources for the languages used in Verbmobil: German and English with current work on Japanese.",
        "Additionally, the kernel generator itself can be modularized furthermore into two separate components.",
        "The task of the so – called rni-croplanning component is to plan an utterance on a phrase – or sentence – level (Hovy, 1996) including word – choice (section 2).",
        "It generates an annotated dependency structure which is used by the syntactic generation component to realize an appropriate surface string for it (section 3).",
        "The main goal of this further modularization is a stepwise constraining of the search – space of alternative linguistic realizations, using abstracted views on different choice criteria.",
        "Multilingual generation in dialog translation imposes strong requirements on the generation module.",
        "A very prominent problem is the non-wellformedness (incorrectness, irrelevance, and inconsistency) of spontaneous input.",
        "It forces the realization of robust generation to be able to cope with erroneous and incomplete input data so that the quality of the generated output may vary between syntactically correct sentences and semantically understandable utterances.",
        "On the level of knowledge sources this is achieved by using a highly declarative HPSG grammar which very closely reflects the latest developments of the underlying linguistic theory (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and covers phenomena of spoken language.",
        "This HPSG is compiled into a TAG grammar in an offline preprocessing step (Kasper et al., 1995) which keeps the declarative nature of the grammar intact (section 3).",
        "Maybe the most important requirement on the generation module of a speech – to – speech translation system is real – time processing.",
        "The",
        "above mentioned features of VM-GECO contribute to the efficiency of the generation component.",
        "The TAG-formalism is well known for the existence of efficient syntactic generation algorithms (Kilger and Finkler, 1995).",
        "In general, all knowledge sources of all modules are declarative.",
        "The main advantage is that this allows for an easier adaptation of the generation component to other domains, languages and semantic representation languages besides the easier extendability of the current system.",
        "The feasibility of the language adaptation was proved in the Verbmobil project itself where the (originally English) generator was recently extended to cover German and is currently adapted for Japanese.",
        "The adaptation to another domain and also to another specification language for intermediate structures was shown in another translation project which uses in contrast to Verbmobil an interlingua based approach (section 4.1)."

        "A generation system for target language utterances in an approach to speech-to-speech translation has to work on input elements representing intermediate results of recognition, analysis, and transfer components.",
        "In that setting, several of the tasks of a complete natural language generation system such as selection and organization of the contents to be expressed are outside of the control of our generator.",
        "They have been decided by the human user of the translation system or they have been negotiated and computed by a transfer component.",
        "Nevertheless, there remain a number of different but highly interrelated subtasks of the generation process where decisions have to be made in order to determine and realize the translation result to be sent to a speech synthesis component.",
        "The diverse subtasks – often collectively denoted as microplanning (cf. (Levelt, 1989; Hovy, 1996)) – comprise the planning of a rough structure of the target language utterance, the determination of sentence borders, sentence type, topicalization, theme-rheme organization of sentential units, focus control, utilization of nominalized, or infinitival style, as well as triggering the generation of anaphora and lexical choice.",
        "In addition, they have to address the problem of expressibility of the selected contents in a text realization component, i.e., bridging the generation gap (see (Meteer, 1990)).",
        "The input to our microplanning component consists of semantic representations encoded in a minimal recursive structure following a variant of UDRT.",
        "Each individual indicated by some input utterance is formally represented by a discourse referent.",
        "Information about the individual is encoded within the DRS-conditions.",
        "Relations between descriptions of different discourse referents lead to a hierarchical semantic structure (see Figure 1 for a graphical representation of fragments of an example input to the generator).",
        "Discourse referents are depicted as boxes headed by individual names in; conditions are illustrated within those boxes.",
        "Besides these input terms from the transfer component, the generator may access knowledge about the dialogue act, the dialogue history as well as some prosodic information of the user's utterance.",
        "The output of the microplanner is a sentence plan that serves as input for the syntactic realization component.",
        "It describes a dependency tree over lexical items annotated with syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information which is relevant to produce an acceptable utterance and guide the speech synthesis component."

        "up demonstrative (13 1t2 ht1)",
        "order of decisions over others.",
        "E.g., the choice of an interrogative sentence requires an (at least elliptical) verbal phrase as a major constituent of the sentence; nominalization or the choice of passive voice depends on the result of word choice, etc.",
        "Therefore, we conceived microplanning as a constraint-satisfaction problem (Kumar, 1992) representing undirected relations between variables.",
        "Thereby, variables are created for elements in the input to the generator.",
        "They are connected by means of weighted constraints.",
        "The domains of the variables correspond to abstractions of possible alternatives for syntactic realizations of the semantic elements including sets of specifications of lexical items and syntactic features.",
        "A solution of the constraint system is a globally consistent instantiation of the variables and is guaranteed to be a valid input for the syntactic generation module.",
        "Since there might be locally optimal mappings that lead to contradiction on a global level, the microplanner generally uses these weighted constraints to direct a backtracking or propagation process.",
        "One the one hand, the advantages of utilizing a constraint system lie in the declarativity of the knowledge sources allowing for an easier adaptation of the system to other domains and languages.",
        "We benefited from this design decision and realized microplanning for English and German by means of merely establishing new rule sets for lexical and syntactic choice.",
        "The core engine for constraint processing was reused without modification.",
        "On the other hand, having defined a suitable representation of the problem to be solved, a constraint – based approach also establishes a testbed for examining the pros and cons of different evaluation methods, including backtracking, constraint propagation, heuristics for the order of the instantiation of variable values, to name a few means of dealing with competition among alternatives and to find a solution.",
        "The microplanner makes use of the minimal recursive structure of its semantic input term (see Fig. 1) by triggering activities by bundles of conditions, discourse referents, and holes representing underspecified scope relations in the input.",
        "These three input categories are reflected by different microplanning rule sets that are applied conjointly during the process of microplanning.",
        "The rules are represented as pattern-condition – action triples.",
        "A pattern is to be matched with part of the input, a condition describes additional context-dependent requirements to be fulfilled by the input, and the action part describes a bundle of syntactic features realizing lexical entities and their relations to complements and modifiers.",
        "A microplanning rule for the combination of the semantic predicates WORK_ACCEPTABLE, ARG3, and PERSPECTIVE which get realized as a finite verb, i.e., representing a 3:1 mapping of semantic predicates to a syntactic specification is shown in Figure 2.",
        "In the condition part of the verbal mapping the existence of a NOM-condition within the semantic input information is tested.",
        "It would forbid the verbal form by demanding a nominalized form.",
        "The action part describes the result of lexical selection (the lemma \"suit\" ) plus generic functions for computing relevant syntactic features like tense and voice.",

        "Entries starting with KEY define identifiers used for computing the preference value of a microplanning rule with respect to the given situation.",
        "In an additional database, KEYs are associated with weights for predefined situation characteristics such as time pressure, or register.",
        "The microplanning content rules are not directly entered by a rule writer but are compiled off – line from several knowledge sources for lexical choice rules, rules for syntactic decisions and linking rules, thereby filtering out contradictory combinations without requiring on – line runtime.",
        "Regarding the sets of alternatives that result",
        "from the application of the microplanning rules, the most direct way of realizing a constraint net seems to be the definition of one variable for each condition, discourse referent, and hole, leading to a variable net as shown in Figure 3.",
        "For our task, it is not enough to define binary matching constraints between each pair of variables that purely test the compatibility of the described syntactic features.",
        "Some syntactic specifications may contain identifications of further entities, e.g., discourse referents and syntactic identifiers which influence the result of the compatibility test between a pair of variables referring to these identifiers.",
        "Thus, the constraint net is not easily subdivided into subnets that can be efficiently evaluated.",
        "The large number of combinations of alternative values is handled by known means for CSP such as uniting variables with 1 – value domains and applying matching mechanisms to their values, computation of 2 – consistency by matching value pairs and filtering out inconsistent ones, storing and reusing knowledge about binary incompatibility and performing intelligent backtracking.",
