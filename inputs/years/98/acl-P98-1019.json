        "The problem of parsing ambiguous structures concerns (i) their representation and (ii) the specification of mechanisms allowing to delay and control their evaluation.",

        "But an efficient control of ambiguous structures also has to take into account lexical as well as syntactic information concerning this object.",
        "We then propose the use of unary quasi-trees specifying constraints at these different levels.",
        "The two devices allow an efficient implementation of the control of the ambiguity.",

        "Most of the approaches dealing with ambiguity are disambiguating techniques.",
        "This preliminary constatation seems trivial and relies on a simple presuposition: the ambiguous structures need to be disambiguated.",
        "However, this is not true from several respects.",
        "Machine translation is a good example: the ambiguity of a sentence in the source language needs very often to be preserved and translated into the target one (cf. (Wedekind97)).",
        "Another remark, in the same perspective: most of the disambiguating techniques rely on a single linguistic level.",
        "In other words, they generally make use of lexical or syntactic or semantic information, exclusively.",
        "But a natural processing of natural language should not work in this way.",
        "All the linguistic levels of NLP (i.e. phonetic, phonologic, lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic) have to be taken into account at the same time.",
        "In other words, processing ambiguity would have to be parallel, not sequential.",
        "The problem is then to use ambiguous structures during the parse without blocking the analysis.",
        "In a first approximation, such a problem comes to parse using underspecified structures.",
        "We will see that this constitutes a part of the solution.",
        "The third and last preliminary remark focuses on the control strategies for the evaluation of ambiguous structures.",
        "These strategies can rely on the formal properties of the ambiguous structure (for example the simplification of a disjunctive formula), on the contextual relations, etc.",
        "But the ambiguous objects can themselves bear important information specifying some restrictions.",
        "We will develop in this paper several examples illustrating this point.",
        "The approach described here make an intensive use of this kind of constraints, also called control relations.",
        "We present in this paper a technique called controlled disjunctions allowing to represent and implement an efficient control of ambiguous structures at the lexical and phrase-structure level.",
        "We illustrate this technique using the HPSG framework, but it could be used in all kind of feature-based representations.",
        "This approach relies (i) on the representation of constraints relations between the feature values and (ii) on the propagation of such relations.",
        "We insist on the fact that this is not a disambiguating technique, but a control of the evaluation of ambiguous structures.",
        "In order to increase the number of constraints controlling an ambiguous structure, we generalize the use of control re",
        "lations at the phrase-structure level.",
        "We propose for that a particular representation of hierarchical relations for ambiguous objects called unary quasi-trees.",
        "This paper is threefold.",
        "In a first section, we present the limits of the classical representation of ambiguity and in particular the technique of named disjunctions.",
        "The second section describes the controlled disjunction method applied to the lexical level.",
        "We describe in the third section the generalization of this technique to the phrase-structure level using unary quasi-trees and we show how this approach is useful for an online control of the ambiguity during the parse.",
        "2 Ambiguity and Disjunctions Several techniques have been proposed for the interpretation and the control of disjunctive structures.",
        "For example, delaying the evaluation of the disjunctive formulae until obtaining enough information allows partial disambiguation (cf. (Kart-tunen84)).",
        "Another solution consists in converting the disjunctive formulae into a conjunctive form (using negation) as proposed by (Nakazawa88) or (Maxwell91).",
        "We can also make use of the properties of the formula in order to eliminate inconsistencies.",
        "This approach, described in (Maxwell91), relies on the conversion of the original disjunctive formulae into a set of contexted constraints which allows, by the introduction of propositional variables (i) to convert the formulae into a conjunctive form, and (ii) to isolate a subset of formulae, the disjunctive residue (the negation of the unsatisfiable constraints).",
        "The problem of the satisfiability of the initial formula is then reduced to that of the disjunctive residue.",
        "This approach is fruitful and several methods rely on this idea to refer formulae with an index (a propositional variable, an integer, etc.).",
        "It is the case in particular with named disjunctions (see (D6rre90), (Krieger93) or (Gerdemann95)) which propose a compact representation of control phenomena and co-variancy.",
        "A named disjunction (noted hereafter ND) binds several disjunctive formulae with an index (the name of the disjunction).",
        "These formulae have the same arity and their disjuncts are ordered.",
        "They are linked by a covariancy relation: when one disjunct in a ND is selected (i.e. interpreted to true), then all the disjuncts occurring at the same position into the other formulae of the ND also have to be true.",
        "The example (1) presents the lexical entry of the german determiner den.",
        "The covariation is indicated by three disjunctive formulae composing the named disjunction indexed by 1.",
        "But the named disjunction technique also has some limits.",
        "In particular, NDs have to represent all the relations between formulae in a covariant way.",
        "This leads to a lot of redundancy and a loss of the compactness in the sense that the disjuncts don't contain anymore the possible values but all the possible variancies according to the other formulae.",
        "Some techniques has been proposed in order to eliminate this drawback and in particular: the dependency group representation (see (Griffith96)) and the controlled disjunctions (see (Blache97)).",
        "The former relies on an enrichment of the Maxwell and Kaplan's contexted constraints.",
        "In this approach, constraints are composed of the conjunction of base constraints (corresponding to the initial disjunctive form) plus a control formula representing the way in which values are choosen.",
        "The second approach, described in the next section, consists in a specific representation of control relations relying on a clear distinction between (i) the possible values (the disjuncts) and (ii) the relations between these ambiguous values and other elements of the structure.",
        "This approach allows a direct implementation of the implication relations (i.e. the oriented controls) instead of simple covariancies."
