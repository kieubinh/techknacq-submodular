        "In this article, we apply to natural language parsing and tagging the device of trigger-pair predictors, previously employed exclusively within the field of language modelling for speech recognition.",
        "Given the task of predicting the correct rule to associate with a parse-tree node, or the correct tag to associate with a word of text, and assuming a particular class of parsing or tagging model, we quantify the information gain realized by taking account of rule or tag trigger-pair predictors, i.e. pairs consisting of a \"triggering\" rule or tag which has already occurred in the document being processed, together with a specific \"triggered\" rule or tag whose probability of occurrence within the current sentence we wish to estimate.",
        "This information gain is shown to be substantial.",
        "Further, by utilizing trigger pairs taken from the same general sort of document as is being processed (e.g. same subject matter or same discourse type) – as opposed to predictors derived from a comprehensive general set of English texts – we can significantly increase this information gain."

        "If a person or device wished to predict which words or grammatical constructions were about to occur in some document, intuitively one of the most helpful things to know would seem to be which words and constructions occurred within the last half-dozen or dozen sentences of the document.",
        "Other things being equal, a text that has so far been larded with, say, mountaineering terms, is a good bet to continue featuring them.",
        "An author with the habit of ending sentences with adverbial clauses of confirmation, e.g. \"as we all know\", will probably keep up that habit as the discourse progresses.",
        "Within the field of language modelling for speech recognition, maintaining a cache of words that have occurred so far within a document, and using this information to alter probabilities of occurrence of particular choices for the word being predicted, has proved a winning strategy (Kuhn et al., 1990).",
        "Models using trigger pairs of words, i.e. pairs consisting of a \"triggering\" word which has already occurred in the document being processed, plus a specific \"triggered\" word whose probability of occurrence as the next word of the document needs to be estimated, have yielded perplexityl reductions of 29-38% over the baseline trigram model, for a 5-million-word Wall Street Journal training corpus (Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "This paper introduces the idea of using trigger-pair techniques to assist in the prediction of rule and tag occurrences, within the context of natural-language parsing and tagging.",
        "Given the task of predicting the correct rule to associate with a parse-tree node, or the correct tag to associate with a word of text, and assuming a particular class of parsing or tagging model, we quantify the information gain realized by taking account of rule or tag trigger-pair predictors, i.e. pairs consisting of a \"triggering\" rule or tag which has already occurred in the document being processed, plus a specific \"triggered\" rule or tag whose probability of occurrence within the current sentence we wish to estimate.",
        "In what follows, Section 2 provides a basic overview of trigger-pair models.",
        "Section 3 describes the experiments we have performed, which to a large extent parallel successful modelling experiments within the field of language modelling for speech recognition.",
        "In the first experiment, we investigate the use of trigger pairs to predict both rules and tags over our full corpus of around a million words.",
        "The subsequent experiments investigate the",
        "additional information gains accruing from trigger – pair modelling when we know what sort of document is being parsed or tagged.",
        "We present our experimental results in Section 4, and discuss them in Section 5.",
        "In Section 6, we present some example trigger pairs; and we conclude, with a glance at projected future research, in Section 7."

        "Trigger – pair modelling research has been pursued within the field of language modelling for speech recognition over the last decade (Beeferman et al., 1997; Della Pietra et al., 1992; Kupiec, 1989; Lau, 1994; Lau et al., 1993; Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "Fundamentally, the idea is a simple one: if you have recently seen a word in a document, then it is more likely to occur again, or, more generally, the prior occurrence of a word in a document affects the probability of occurrence of itself and other words.",
        "More formally, from an information – theoretic viewpoint, we can interpret the process as the relationship between two dependent random variables.",
        "Let the outcome (from the alphabet of outcomes Ay) of a random variable Y be observed and used to predict a random variable X (with alphabet Ax).",
        "The probability distribution of X, in our case, is dependent on the outcome of Y.",
        "The average amount of information necessary to specify an outcome of X (measured in bits) is called its entropy H(X) and can also be viewed as a measure of the average ambiguity of its outcome:2",
        "The mutual information between X and Y is a measure of entropy (ambiguity) reduction of X from the observation of the outcome of Y.",
        "This is the entropy of X minus its a posteriori entropy, having observed the outcome of Y.",
        "The dependency information between a word and its history may be captured by the trigger pair.3 A trigger pair is an ordered pair of words t and w. Knowledge that the trigger word t has occurred within some window of words in the history, changes",
        "the probability estimate that word w will occur subsequently.",
        "Selection of these triggers can be performed by calculating the average mutual information between word pairs over a training corpus.",
        "In this case, the alphabet Ax = {w, t7}, the presence or absence of word w; similarly, Ay = {t, t}, the presence or absence of the triggering word in the history.",
        "This is a measure of the effect that the knowledge of the occurrence of the triggering word t has on the occurence of word w, in terms of the entropy (and therefore perplexity) reduction it will provide.",
        "Clearly, in the absence of other context (i.e. in the case of the a priori distribition of X), this information will be additional.",
        "However, once \"related contextual information is included (for example by building a trigram model, or, using other triggers for the same word), this is no longer strictly true.",
        "Once the trigger pairs are chosen, they may be used to form constraint functions to be used in a maximum – entropy model, alongside other constraints.",
        "Models of this form are extremely versatile, allowing the combination of short – and long – range information.",
        "To construct such a model, one transforms the trigger pairs into constraint functions",
        "The expected values of these functions are then used to constrain the model, usually in combination of with other constraints such as similar functions embodying uni – , bi – and trigram probability estimates.",
        "(Beeferman et al., 1997) models more accurately the effect of distance between triggering and triggered word, showing that for non – self – triggers,' the triggering effect decays exponentially with distance.",
        "For self – triggers,' the effect is the same except that the triggering effect is lessened within a short range of the word.",
        "Using a model of these distance effects, they are able to improve the performance of a trigger model.",
        "We are unaware of any work on the use of trigger pairs in parsing or tagging.",
        "In fact, we have not found any previous research in which extrasentential data of any sort are applied to the problem of parsing or tagging."

        "we adopt the simple mutual-information approach used in (Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "We carry over into the domain of tags and rules an experiment from Rosenfeld's paper the details of which we outline below.",
        "The idea is to measure the information contributed (in bits, or, equivalently in terms of perplexity reduction) by using the triggers.",
        "Using this technique requires special care to ensure that information \"added\" by the triggers is indeed additional information.",
        "For this reason, in all our experiments we use the unigram model as our base model and we allow only one trigger for each tag (or rule) token.'",
        "We derive these unigram probabilities from the training corpus and then calculate the total mutual information gained by using the trigger pairs, again with respect to the training corpus.",
        "When using trigger pairs, one usually restricts the trigger to occur within a certain window defined by its distance to the triggered token.",
        "In our experiments, the window starts at the sentence prior to that containing the token and extends back W (the window size) sentences.",
        "The choice to use sentences as the unit of distance is motivated by our intention to incorporate triggers of this form into a probabilistic treebank-based parser and tagger, such as (Black et al.. 1998; Black et al., 1997; Brill, 1994: Collins, 1996: Jelinek et al., 1994; Nlagerman, 1995; Ratna-parkhi, 1997).",
        "All such parsers and taggers of which we are aware use only intrasentential information in predicting parses or tags, and we wish to remove this information, as far as possible, from our results ' .",
        "The window was not allowed to cross a document boundary.",
        "The perplexity of the task before taking the trigger-pair information into account for tags was 224.0 and for rules was 57.0.",
        "The characteristics of the training corpus we employ are given in Table 1.",
        "The corpus, a subsets of the ATR/Lancaster General-English Treebank (Black et al., 1996), consists of a sequence of sentences which have been tagged and parsed by human experts in terms of the ATR English Grammar, a broad-coverage grammar of English with a high level of analytic detail (Black et al., 1996; Black et al., 1997).",

        "This is not completely possible, since correlations, even if slight, will exist between intra – and extrasentential information 8specifically, a roughly-900,000 – word subset of the full ATR/Lancaster General – English Treebank (about 1.05 million words), from which all 150,000 words were excluded that were treebanked by the two least accurate ATR/Lancaster treebankers (expected hand – parsing error rate 32%, versus less than 10% overall for the three remaining treebankers)",
        "tic and syntactic, and includes around 2000 different tags, which classify nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs via over 100 semantic categories.",
        "As examples of the level of syntactic detail, exhaustive syntactic and semantic analysis is performed on all nominal compounds; and the full range of attachment sites is available within the Grammar for sentential and phrasal modifiers, and are used precisely in the Treebank.",
        "The Treebank actually consists of a set of documents, from a variety of sources.",
        "Crucially for our experiments (see below), the idea9 informing the selection of (the roughly 2000) documents for inclusion in the Treebank was to pack into it the maximum degree of document variation along many different scales – document length, subject area, style, point of view, etc. – but without establishing a single, predetermined classification of the included documents.",
        "In the first experiment, we examine the effectiveness of using trigger pairs over the entire training corpus.",
        "At the same time we investigate the effect of varying the window size.",
        "In additional experiments, we observe the effect of partitioning our training dataset into a few relatively homogeneous subsets, on the hypothesis that this will decrease perplexity.",
        "It seems reasonable that in different text varieties, different sets of trigger pairs will be useful, and that tokens which do not have effective triggers within one text variety may have them in another.1° To investigate the utility of partitioning the dataset, we construct a separate set of trigger pairs for each class.",
        "These triggers are only active for their respective class and are independent of each other.",
        "Their total mutual information is compared to that derived in exactly the same way from a random partition of our corpus into the same number of classes, each comprised of the same number of documents.",

        "The main result of this paper is to show that analogous to the case of words in language modelling, a significant amount of extrasentential information can be extracted from the long – range history of a document, using trigger pairs for tags and rules.",
        "Although some redundancy of information is inevitable, we have taken care to exclude as much information as possible that is already available to (intrasentential – data – based, i.e. all known) parsers and taggers.",
        "Quantitatively, the studies of (Rosenfeld, 1996) yielded a total mutual information gain of 0.38 bits, using Wall Street Journal data, with one trigger per word.",
        "In a parallel experiment, using the same technique, but on the ATR/Lancaster corpus, the total mutual information of the triggers for tags was 0.41 bits.",
        "This figure increases to 0.52 bits when tags further away than 135 tags (the approximate equivalent in words to the optimal window size in sentences) are excluded from the history.",
        "For the remainder of our experiments, we do not use as part of the history the tags/rules from the sentence containing the token to be predicted.",
        "This is motivated by our wish to exclude the intrasentential information which is already available to parsers and taggers.",
        "In the case of tags, using the optimal window size, the gain was 0.31 bits, and for rules the information gain was 0.12 bits.",
        "Although these figures are not as large as for the case where intrasentential information is incorporated, they are sufficiently close to encourage us to exploit this information in our models.",
        "For the case of words, the evidence shows that triggers derived in the same manner as the triggers in our experiments, can provide a substantial amount of new information when used in combination with sophisticated language models.",
        "For example, (Rosenfeld, 1996) used a maximum – entropy",
        "model trained on 5 million words, with only trigger, uni-, bi and trigram constraints, to measure the test-set perpexity reduction with respect to a \"compact\" backoff trigram model, a well-respected model in the language-modelling field.",
        "When the top six triggers for each word were used, test-set perplexity was reduced by 25%.",
        "Furthermore, when a more sophisticated version of this model13 was applied in conjunction with the SPHINX II speech recognition system (Huang et al., 1993), a 10-14% reduction in word error rate resulted (Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "We see no reason why this effect should not carry over to tag and rule tokens, and are optimistic that long-range trigger information can be used in both parsing and tagging to improve performance.",
        "For words (Rosenfeld, 1996), self-triggers – words which triggered themselves – were the most frequent kind of triggers (68% of all word triggers were self-triggers).",
        "This is also the case for tags and rules.",
        "For tags, 76.8% were self-triggers, and for rules, 96.5% were self-triggers.",
