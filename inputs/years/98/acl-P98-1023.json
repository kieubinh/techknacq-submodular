        "First we will give a definition of quantifiers.",
        "Semantically, quantifiers are elements that serve to quantify, or enumerate, some target.",
        "The target can be an entity, in which case the number of objects is quantified, or an action, in which case the number of events (i.e. iterations of the action) are quantified.",
        "The quantification can be by a cardinal number, or by a more vague expression, like several or many.",
        "In Japanese, quantifiers (Q) are mainly realised in two ways: numeral-classifier combinations (XC) and quantificational nouns (N).",
        "Note that these nouns are often treated as adverbs, as they typically function as adjuncts that modify verbs, a function prototypically carried out by adverbs.",
        "They can however head noun phrases, and take some case-markers, so we classify them as nouns.",
        "Numeral classifiers form a closed class, although a large one.",
        "Japanese and Korean both have two or three hundred numeral classifiers (not counting units), although typically individual speakers use far less, between 30 and 80 (Downing, 1995, 346).",
        "Syntactically, numeral classifiers are a subclass of nouns.",
        "The main property distinguishing them from prototypical nouns is that they cannot stand alone.",
        "Typically they postfix to numerals, forming a quantifier phrase, although they can also combine with the quantificational prefix sti \"some\" or the interrogative nani \"what\":",

        "Semantically, classifiers both classify and quantify the referent of the noun phrase they collocate with.",
        "Quantificational nouns, such as takusan \"much/many\", subete \"all\" and ichibu \"some\", only quantify their targets, there is no classification involved.",
        "Numeral classifier combinations appear in seven major patterns of use (following Asahioka et al.",
        "(1990)) as shown below (T refers to the quantified target noun phrase, m is a case-marker):",

        "In the pre-nominal construction the relation between the target noun phrase and quantifier is explicit.",
        "For numeral-classifier combinations the quantification can be of the object denoted by the noun phrase itself as in (6); or of a subpart of it as in (7) (see Bond and Paik (1997) for a fuller discussion).",

        "Inoue (1983) pointed out that quasi-objects, noun phrases masked with the accusative case-marker but failing other tests for objecthood, could also be targets.",
        "Miyagawa (1989) gives a comprehensive con-figurational explanation, where the target and quantifier must mutually c-command each other (that is, neither the target nor the quantifier dominates the other, and the first branching node that dominates either one, dominates the other).",
        "The restriction to nominative and accusative targets is explained by proposing a difference in structure.",
        "Verb arguments sub-categorized for in the lexicon are noun phrases, where the case-marker is a clitic and thus can be c-commanded, whereas adjuncts are headed by their markers, to form post-positional phrases which are thus not available as targets.",
        "The c-command relation is applied to both the noun phrases themselves and traces.",
        "Quantifiers can be scrambled (moved from their base position after their target) leaving a trace if the target is an affected Theme NP, and the target and quantifier are governed by the verb that assigns this thematic role.",
        "Thus quantifiers associated with affected themes can move within the sentence.",
        "Affected themes are things that are \"changed, created, converted, extinguished, consumed, destroyed or gotten-rid of\".",
        "Miyagawa (1989, 57) proposes a syntactic test for affectiveness: affected themes can occure in the intransitive resultative construction -te-aru.",
        "Alam (1997) looks at the problem from a different angle, and proposes that only quantifiers which are interpreted \"distributively or as a quantified event\" can float, as they take wide scope beyond the NP.",
        "A quantified noun phrase will also quantify the event if the noun phrase measures-out the event, where \"direct internal arguments undergoing change in the event described by the verb measure out the event\" a very similar description to that of affected theme.",
        "However, Jackendoff (1996) has shown that a wide variety of arguments can measure out processes, not just subjects and objects, but also the complements of prepositional phrases.",
        "Which case-roles measure out the process can be pragmatically determined as well as lexically stipulated, so it is not a simple matter to determine which arguments are relevent.",
        "The excellent distributional analysis of Downing (1996) shows that actual cases of floating tend to be absolutive, that is quantifiers largely float from intransitive subjects (67%) or direct objects of transitive verbs (24%) rather than from transitive subjects (4%) or indirect objects (1%).",
        "On the question of why quantifiers appear outside of the noun phrases they quantify, there have been two explanations: Discourse new information floats to the pre-verb focus position (Downing, 1996; Kim, 1995), quantifiers float from noun phrases that 'measure out' an event (Alam, 1997).",
        "We speculate that there may be a performance based reason.",
        "Hawkins (1994) has shown that many phenomena claimed to be discourse related are in fact largely due to performance.",
