        "The functional, formal and communicative role of interface terms within these systems, once instigated, has already been maintained through changes in the overall architecture and constitution of the Verbmobil consortium.",
        "There are two aspects to our story:",

        "• the linguistic requirements of the translation task at the heart of the system.",

        "Thanks to our many Verbmobil colleagues who helped to design and develop the results presented here, and also to the anonymous reviewers for giving useful hints to improve this paper.",
        "The prominence of the engineering requirements is further heightened by the fact that we are dealing with a spoken dialogue system which must strive towards real time interactions.",
        "We proceed by describing the requirements of the Verbmobi/ Research Prototype, the actual contents of the Verbmobil Interface Term (henceforth VIT), the semantic formalism encoded within VITs and processing aspects.",

        "The linguistic design criteria for VITs derive mainly from the syntactic and semantic analysis module, labelled SynSem, the generation and the transfer modules.",
        "One point that should be made at the outset is that these linguistic modules really are modules, rather than, say, organisational constructs in some larger constraints system.",
        "In practice, these modules are developed at different sites, may be implemented in different programming languages or use different internal linguistic formalisms, and, indeed, there may be interchangeable modules for the same function.",

        "The primary definition criterion within the linguistic modules has been the translation task.",
        "The actual translation operation is performed in the transfer module as a mapping between semantic representations of the source and target languages, see (Dorna and Emele, 1996).",
        "However, the information requirements of this process are flexible, since information from various levels of analysis are used in disambiguation within the transfer module, including prosody and dialogue structure.",
        "To a large extent the information requirements divide into two parts:",
        "• the expressive adequacy of the semantic representation; • representing other types of linguistic information so as to meet the disambiguation requirements with the minimum of redundancy.",
        "The design of the semantic representations encoded within VITs has been guided by an ongoing movement in representational semantic formalisms which takes as a starting point the fact that certain key features of a purely logical semantics are not fully defined in natural language utterances and typically play no part in translation operations.",
        "This has been most clearly demonstrated for cases where quantifier scope ambiguities are exactly preserved under translation.",
        "The response to these observations is termed underspecification and various such underspecified formalisms have been defined.",
        "In one sense underspecification is, in itself, a form of information management, in that only the information that is actually present in an utterance is represented, further disambiguation being derived from the context.",
        "In the absence of such contextual information further specificity can only be based on guesswork.",
        "While the management of information in the VIT semantics consists of leaving unsaid what cannot be adequately specified, the amount of information and also the type of information in the other partitions of the VIT (see Section 2.1) has been determined by the simple principle of providing information on justified demand.",
        "The information provided is also quite varied but the unifying property is that the requirements are defined by the specific needs of transfer, in distinguishing cases that are truly ambiguous under translation or need to be resolved.",
