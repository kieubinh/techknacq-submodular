        "Recently, the concept of valency has gained considerable attention.",
        "Not only do all linguistic theories refer to some reformulation of the traditional notion of valency (in the form of 0 grid, subcategorization list, argument list, or extended domain of locality); there is a growing number of parsers based on binary relations between words (Eisner, 1997; Maruyama, 1990).",
        "Given this interest in the valency concept, and the fact that word order is one of the main difference between phrase-structure based approaches (henceforth PSG) and dependency grammar (DG), it is valid to ask whether DG can capture word order phenomena without recourse to phrasal nodes, traces, slashed categories, etc.",
        "A very early result on the weak generative equivalence of context-free grammars and DGs suggested that DGs are incapable of describing surface word order (Gaifman, 1965).",
        "This result has recently been critizised to apply only to impoverished DGs which do not properly represent formally the expressivity of contemporary DG variants (Neuhaus Sz Broker, 1997).",
        "Our position will be that dependency relations are motivated semantically (Tesniere, 1959), and need not be projective (i.e., may cross if projected onto the surface ordering).",
        "We argue for so-called word order domains, consisting of partially ordered sets of words and associated with nodes in the dependency tree.",
        "These order domains constitute a tree defined by set inclusion, and surface word order is determined by traversing this tree.",
        "A syntactic analysis therefor consists of two linked, but dissimilar trees.",
        "Sec.",
        "2 will briefly review approaches to word order in DG.",
        "In Sec. 3, word order domains will be defined, and Sec. 4 introduces a modal logic to describe dependency structures.",

        "Extraction of, e.g., objects is analyzed by establishing an additional dependency called visitor between the verb and the extractee, which requires the reverse order, as in \"visitor of verb precedes it\".",
        "This results in inconsistencies, since an extracted object must follow the verb (being its object) and at the same time precede it (being its visitor).",
        "The approach compromises the semantic motivation of dependencies by adding purely order-induced dependencies.",
