        "Due to its central role in natural language and its intriguing properties, reference and anaphor resolution has been a central topic for NLP research.",
        "Given the intensive attention devoted.",
        "to this subject, it can however be said that sentential anaphor processing has been quite overlooked, when compared to the amount of research effort put in, tackling non sentential anaphoric dependencies.",

        "implicit assumption that no substantial difference exists between the two processes 1.",
        "While this may be arguably true for the heuristics involved in picking out a given antecedent from a list of suitable candidates, a more subtle point asks itself to be made when we focus on the syntactic conditions which sentential anaphoric relations comply with, but from which non sentential ones are exempt.",
        "In theoretical linguistics these grammatical conditions are grouped under the heading of Binding Theory.",
        "In computational linguistics however, though there have been a few papers, directly concerned with the implementation of this theory, mainstream research tends, to disregard its conceptual, grammatical or practical modularity.",
        "When it comes to define the algorithm for setting up the list of suitable candidates from which the antecedent should be chosen, binding conditions, holding just at the sentential level, are most, often put on a, par with any other kind of conditions, morphological, semantic, pragmatic, etc., which hold for anaphonc relations at both sentential and non sentential level.",
        "The interesting point to be made in this connection is that, if the modularity of grammatical knowledge is to be ensured, in a sound reference resolution system, more attention should be paid to previous attempts ot implementing Binding Theory.",
        "It would then become evident that this theory, in its current formulation, appears as a, piece of formalised grammatical knowledge .which however escapes a full and lean declarative implementation.",
        "In fact implementation efforts concerning Binding Theory 2 bring to light what tend to be eclipsed by mainstream Clean theoretical formulations of it.",

        "otherwise; (iii) recursion: repeat (i) with a new assignment until all possible assignments are exhausted.",
        "This sort of resistance to declarative encompassing is also apparent when one considers how Binding Theory is handled in grammatical theories developed on top of constraint based formalisms and particularly concerned with computational implementability, like LFG or HPSG.",
        "As to HPSG, it has passed quite unnoticed that its Binding Theory is the only piece of the grammar fragment not encoded in its own formalism.",

        "is encoded in the adopted formalism, Binding Theory escapes such encoding.",

        "(96) subsequent elaboration on this issue implied that some kind of essential limitation of the formalism might have been reached and that HPSG Binding Theory is still waiting to be accommodated into HPSG grammars.",
        "As to the LFG formulation of Binding Theory, it requires the integration of inside-out equations,, a special purpose extension to the general declarative formalism.",
        "And even though initial scepticism about their tractability was dissipated by Kaplan and Maxwell (88), the recent survey of Backofen et al.",

        "Second, by the exhibition of an example, the new shape of the theory, is shown to support tull declarative implementation in basic HPSG formalism.",
