        "This study exploits statistical redundancy inherent in natural language to automatically predict scores for essays.",
        "We use a hybrid feature identification method, including syntactic structure analysis, rhetorical structure analysis, and topical analysis, to score essay responses from test-takers of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) and the Test of Written English (TWE).",
        "For each essay question, a stepwise linear regression analysis is run on a training set (sample of human scored essay responses) to extract a weighted set of predictive features for each test question.",
        "Score prediction for cross-validation sets is calculated from the set of predictive features.",
        "Exact or adjacent agreement between the Electronic Essay Rater (e-rater) score predictions and human rater scores ranged from 87% to 94% across the 15 test questions."

        "This paper describes the development and evaluation of a prototype system designed for the purpose of automatically scoring essay responses.",
        "The paper reports on evaluation results from scoring 13 sets of essay data from the Analytical Writing Assessments of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) (see the GMAT Web site at http://www.gmat.org/ for sample questions) and 2 sets of essay data from the Test of Written English (TWE) (see http://www.toefl.org/ tstprpmt.html for sample TWE questions).",
        "Electronic Essay Rater (e-rater) was designed to automatically analyze essay features based on writing characteristics specified at each of six score points in the scoring guide used by human raters for manual scoring (also available at http://www.gmat.org/).",
        "The scoring guide indicates that an essay that stays on the topic of the question has a strong, coherent and well-organized argument structure, and displays a variety of word use and syntactic structure will receive a score at the higher end of the six-point scale (5 or 6).",
        "Lower scores are assigned to essays as these characteristics diminish.",
        "One of our main goals was to design a system that could score an essay based on features specified in the scoring guide for manual scoring.",
        "E-rater features include rhetorical structure, syntactic structure, and topical analysis.",
        "For each essay question, a stepwise linear regression analysis is run on a set of training data (human-scored essay responses) to extract a weighted set of predictive features for each test question.",
        "Final score prediction for cross-validation uses the weighted predictive feature set identified during training.",
        "Score prediction accuracy is determined by measuring agreement between human rater scores and e-rater score predictions.",
        "In accordance with human interrater \"agreement\" standards, human and e-rater scores also \"agree\" if there is an exact match or if the scores differ by no more than one point (adjacent agreement)."

        "GMAT essay questions are of two types: Analysis of an Issue (issue) and Analysis of an Argunzent (argument).",
        "The GMAT issue essay asks the writer to respond to a general question and to provide \"reasons and/or examples\" to support his or her position on an issue introduced by the test question.",
        "The GMAT argument essay focuses the writer on the argument in a given piece of text, using the term argument in the sense of a rational presentation of points with the purpose of persuading the reader.",
        "The scoring guides indicate that an essay will receive a score based on the examinee's demonstration of a well-developed essay.",
        "In this study, we try to identify organization of an essay through automated analysis and identification of the rhetorical (or argument) structure of the essay.",
        "Argument structure in the rhetorical sense may or may not correspond to paragraph divisions.",
        "One can make a point in a phrase, a sentence, two or three sentences, a paragraph, and so on.",
        "For automated argument identification, e-rater identifies 'rhetorical' relations, such as Parallelism and Contrast that can appear at almost any level of discourse.",
        "This is part of the reason that human readers must also rely on cue words to identify new arguments in an essay.",
        "Literature in the field of discourse analysis supports our approach.",
        "It points out that rhetorical cue words and structures can be identified and used for computer-based discourse analysis (Cohen (1984), (Mann and Thompson (1988), Hovy, et al. (1992), Hirschberg and Litman (1993), Vander Linden and Martin (1995), and Knott (1996)).",
        "E-rater follows this approach by using rhetorical cue words and structure features, in addition to other topical and syntactic information.",
        "We adapted the conceptual framework of conjunctive relations from Quirk, et al. (1985) in which cue terms, such as \"In summary\" and \"In conclusion,\" are classified as conjuncts used for summarizing.",
        "Cue words such as \"perhaps,\" and \"possibly\" are considered to be \"belief\" words used by the writer to express a belief in developing an argument in the essay.",
        "Words like \"this\" and \"these\" may often be used to flag that the writer has not changed topics (Sidner (1986)).",
        "We also observed that in certain discourse contexts structures such as infinitive clauses mark the beginning of a new argument.",
        "E-rater's automated argument partitioning and annotation program (APA) outputs an annotated version of each essay in which the argument units of the essays are labeled with regard to their status as \"marking the beginning of an argument,\" Or \"marking argument",
        "development.\" APA also outputs a version of the essay that has been partitioned \"by argument\", instead of \"by paragraph,\" as it was originally partitioned by the test-taker.",
        "APA uses rules for argument annotation and partitioning based on syntactic and paragraph-based distribution of cue words, phrases and structures to identify rhetorical structure.",
        "Relevant cue words and terms are stored in a cue word lexicon."

        "The system computes cosine correlations between the vector for a given test essay and the six vectors representing the trained categories; the category that is most similar to the test essay is assigned as the evaluation of its content.",
        "An advantage of using the cosine correlation is that it is not sensitive to essay length, which may vary considerably.",
        "The other content similarity measure, is computed separately by ArgContent for each argument in the test essay and is based on the kind of term weighting used in information retrieval.",
        "For this purpose, the word frequency vectors for the six score categories, described above, are converted to vectors of word weights.",
        "The weight for word i in score category s is:",
        "where freq., is the frequency of word i in category s, max_freq, is the frequency of the most frequent word in s (after a stop list of words has been removed), n_essaysto„,, is the total number of training essays across all six categories, and n_essaysi is the number of training essays containing word i.",
        "The first part of the weight formula represents the prominence of word i in the score category, and the second part is the log of the word's inverse document frequency.",
        "For each argument in the test essay, a vector of word weights is also constructed.",
        "Each argument is evaluated by computing cosine correlations between its weighted vector and those of the six score categories, and the most similar category is assigned to the argument.",
        "As a result of this analysis, crater has a set of scores (one per argument) for each test essay.",
        "In a preliminary study, we looked at how well the minimum, maximum, mode, median, and mean of the set of argument scores agreed with the judgments of human raters for the essay as a whole.",
        "The greatest agreement was obtained from an adjusted mean of the argument scores that compensated for an effect of the number of arguments in the essay.",
