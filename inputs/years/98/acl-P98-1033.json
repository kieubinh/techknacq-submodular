        "Lexical ized Tree Adjoining Grammars (LTAG) is a formalism integrating lexicon and grammar (Joshi, 87; Schabes et al., 88) : its description units are lexicalized syntactic trees, the elementary trees.",
        "The formalism is associated with a tree-rewriting process that links sentences with syntactic structures (in either way), by combining the elementary trees with two operations, adjunction and substitution.",
        "We assume the following linguistic features for LTAG elementary trees (Kroch & Joshi, 85; Abeille, 91; Frank, 92):",
        "• lexicalization : elementary trees are anchored by at least one lexical item.",
        "• semantic coherence : the set of lexical items on the frontier of an elementary tree forms exactly one semantic unitl.",
        "• large domain of locality : the elementary",
        "trees anchored by a predicate contain positions for the arguments of the predicate.",
        "Thus semantically void lexical forms (functional words) do not anchor elementary trees on their own.",
        "And words composing an idiomatic expression am multiple anchors of the same elementary tree.",
        "This last feature is known as the predicate-argument cooccurrence principle (PACP).",
        "Trees anchored by a predicate represent the minimal structure so that positions for all arguments are included.",
        "These argumental positions are extended either by receiving substitution or by adjoining at a node.",
        "Adjunction is used to factor out recursion.",
        "Figure 1 shows two elementary trees anchored by the French verbal form mange (eat-pres-sg), whose arguments in the active voice are a subject NP and a direct object NP2.",
        "The first tree shows all arguments in canonical position.",
        "The second tree shows a relativized subject and a pronominal object (accusative clitic).",
        "The argumental nodes are numbered, according to their oblicity order, by an index starting at 0 in the unmarked case (active).",
        "So for instance in passive trees, the subject is number 1, not 0.",
        "Though LTAG units used during derivation are lexicalized trees, the LTAG internal representation makes use of \"pre-lexicalized\" structures, that we will call tree sketches, whose anchor is not instantiated and that are shared by several lexicalized trees.",
        "The set of tree sketches thus forms a syntactic database, in which lexical items pick up the structures they can anchor.",
        "Families group together tree sketches that are likely to be selected by the same lexeme: the tree sketches may show different surface realization of the arguments (pronominal clitic realization, extraction of an argument, subject inversion...) or different diathesis – matchings between semantic arguments and syntactic",
        "functions – (active, passive, middle..) or both.",
        "The lexical forms select their tree sketches by indicating one or several families, and features.",
        "The features may rule out some tree sketches of the selected family, either because of morphological clash (eg.",
        "the passive trees are only selected by past participles) or because of idiosyncrasies.",
        "For instance, the French verb peser (to weight) can roughly be encoded as selecting the transitive family, but it disallows the passive diathesis.",
        "It remains that tree sketches are large linguistic unit.",
        "Each represents a combination of linguistic descriptions that are encoded separately in other formalisms.",
        "For instance, a tree sketch is in general of depth 1, and thus corresponds to a piece of derivation in a formalism using CF rewrite rules (cf (Kasper et al., 95) for the presentation of an LTAG as a compiled HPSG).",
        "This causes redundancy in the set of tree sketches, which makes it difficult to write or maintain an LTAG.",
        "Several authors (Vijay-Shanker et al., 92- hereafter (VSS92) - ; Becker, 93; Evans et al., 95) have proposed practical solutions to represent in a compact way an LTAG.",
        "The idea is to represent canonical trees using an inheritance network and to derive marked syntactic constructions from base tree sketches using lexico-syntactic rules.",
        "(Candito, 96), building on (VSS92), defines an additional layer of linguistic description, called the metagrammar (MG), that imposes a general organization for syntactic information and formalizes the well-formedness of lexicalized structures.",
        "MG not only provides a general overview of the grammar, but also makes it possible for a tool to perform automatically the combination of smaller linguistic units into a tree sketch.",
        "This process of tree sketch building is comparable to a context-free derivation - in the generation way - that would build a minimal clause.",
        "A first difference is that CF derivation is performed for each sentence to generate, while the tree sketches are built out of an MG at compile time.",
        "Another difference is that while CF derivation uses very local units (CF rules), MG uses partial descriptions of trees (Rogers et Vijay-Shanker, 94) more suitable for the expression of syntactic generalizations.",
        "MG offers a common, principle-based frame for syntactic description, to fill in for different languages or domains.",
        "In section 2 we present the linguistic and formal characteristics of MG (in a slightly modified version), in section 3 the compilation in an LTAG, and in section 4 we describe the instantiation of the MG for French and Italian.",
        "Finally we give some possible applications in section 5."

        "Formally the MG takes up the proposal of (VSS92) to represent grammar as a multiple inheritance network, whose classes specify syntactic structures as partial descriptions of trees (Rogers & Vijay-Shanker, 94).",
        "While trees specify for any pair of nodes either a precedence relation or a path of parent relations, these partial descriptions of trees, are sets of constraints that may leave underspecified the relation existing between two nodes.",
        "The relation between two nodes may be further specified, either directly or by inference, by adding constraints, either in subclasses or in lateral classes in the inheritance network.",
        "In the MG, nodes of partial descriptions are augmented with feature structures : one for the feature structures of the future tree sketches and one for the features that are specific to the MG, called meta-features.",
        "These are, for instance, the possible parts of speech of a node or the index (cf Section 1) in the case of argumental nodes.",
        "So a class of an instantiated MG may specify the following slots :",
        "• the (ordered) list of direct parent classes • a partial description of trees • feature structures associated with nodes3 Contrary to (VSS92) nodes are global variables within the whole inheritance network, and classes can add features to nodes without involving them in the partial description.",
        "Inheritance of partial descriptions is monotonic.",
        "The aim is to be able to build pre-lexicalized structures respecting the PACP, and to group together structures likely to pertain for the same lexeme.",
        "In order to achieve this, MG makes use of syntactic functions to express either monolingual or cross-linguistic generalizations (cf the work in LFG, Meaning-Text Theory or",
        "Relational Grammar (RG) - see (Blake, 90) for an overview).",
        "Positing syntactic functions, characterized by syntactic properties, allows to set parallels between constructions for different languages, that are different in surface (for word order or morpho-syntactic marking), but that share a representation in terms of functional dependencies.",
        "Within a language, it allows to abstract from the different surface realizations of a given function and from the different diathesis a predicate can show.",
        "So in MG, subcategorization (hereafter subcat) of predicates is expressed as a list of syntactic functions, and their possible categories.",
        "Following RG, an initial subcat is distinguished, namely the one for the unmarked case, and is modifiable by redistribution of the functions associated with the arguments of the predicate.",
        "Technically, this means that argumental nodes in partial descriptions bear a meta-feature \"initial-function\" and a meta-feature \"function\".",
        "The \"function\" value is by default the \"initialfunction\" value, but can be revised by redistribution.",
        "Redistributions, in a broad sense, comprise",
        "• pure redistributions that do not modify the number of arguments (eg.",
        "full passive).",
        "• reductions of the number of arguments (eg.",
        "agentless passive) • augmentations of the number of arguments (mainly causative).",
        "In MG, structures sharing the same initial subcat can be grouped to form a set of structures likely to be selected by the same lexeme.",
        "For verbal predicates, a minimal clause is partly represented with an ordered list of successive subcats, from the initial one to the final one.",
        "Minimal clauses sharing a final subcat, may differ in the surface realizations of the functions.",

        "Dimension 2 is primarily relevant for verbal predicates.",
        "Further, remaining structures, for instance for argument-less lexemes or for auxiliaries and raising verbs are represented in an additional network, by classes that may inherit shared properties, but that are totally written by hand.",
        "In an instantiated MG for a given language, each terminal class of dimension 1 describes a possible initial subcat and describes partially the verbal morpho-syntax (the verb may appear with a frozen clitic, or a particle in English).",
