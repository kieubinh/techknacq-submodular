        "In this paper we compare the effectiveness of full machine translation (MT) and simple dictionary term lookup (DTL) for the task of English-Japanese news article alignment using the vector space model from multilingual information retrieval.",
        "Matching texts depends essentially on lexical coincidence between the English text and the Japanese translation, and we see that the two methods show the trade-off between reduced transfer ambiguity in MT and increased synonymy in DTL.",
        "Corpus-based approaches to natural language processing are now well established for tasks such as vocabulary and phrase acquisition, word sense disambiguation and pattern learning.",
        "The continued practical application of corpus-based methods is critically dependent on the availability of corpus resources.",
        "In machine translation we are concerned with the provision of bilingual knowledge and we have found that the types of language domains which users are interested in such as news, current affairs and technology, are poorly represented in today's pub-lically available corpora.",
        "Our main area of interest is English-Japanese translation, but there are few clean parallel corpora available in large quantities.",
        "As a result we have looked at ways of automatically acquiring large amounts of parallel text for vocabulary acquisition.",
        "The World Wide Web and other Internet resources provide a potentially valuable source of parallel texts.",
        "Newswire companies for example publish news articles in various languages and various domains every day.",
        "We can expect a coincidence of content in these collections of text, but the degree of parallelism is likely to be less than is the case for texts such as the United Nations and parliamentary proceedings.",
        "Nevertheless, we can expect a coincidence of vocabulary, in the case of names of people and places, organisations and events.",
        "This time-sensitive bilingual vocabulary is valuable for machine translation and makes a significant difference to user satisfaction by improving the comprehensibility of the output.",
        "Our goal is to automatically produce a parallel corpus of aligned articles from collections of English and Japanese news texts for bilingual vocabulary acquisition.",
        "The first stage in this process is to align the news texts.",
        "Previously (Collier et al., 1998) adapted multilingual (also called \"translingual\" or \"cross-language\") information retrieval (MLIR) for this purpose and showed the practicality of the method.",

        "There has recently been much interest in the MLIR task (Carbonell et al., 1997)(Dumais et al., 1996)(Hull and Grefenstette, 1996).",
        "MLIR differs from traditional information retrieval in several respects which we will discuss below.",
        "The most obvious is that we must introduce a translation stage in between matching the query and the texts in the document collection.",
        "Query translation, which is currently considered to be preferable to document collection translation, introduces several new factors to the IR task:",
        "• Term transfer mistakes - analysis is far from perfect in today's MT systems and we must con",
        "sider how to compensate for incorrect translations.",
        "• Unresolved lexical ambiguity - occurs when analysis cannot decide between alternative meanings of words in the target language.",
        "• Synonym selection - when we use an MT system to translate a query, generation will usually result in a single lexical choice, even though alternative synonyms exist.",
        "For matching texts, the MT system may not have chosen the same synonym in the translated query as the author of the matching document.",
        "• Vocabulary limitations - are an inevitable factor when using bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Most of the previous work in MLIR has used simple dictionary term translation within the vector space model (Salton, 1989).",
        "This avoids synonymy selection constraints imposed by sentence generation in machine translation systems, but fails to resolve lexical transfer ambiguity.",
        "Since all possible translations are generated, the correctly matching term is assumed to be contained in the list and term transfer mistakes are not an explicit factor.",
        "Two important issues need to be considered in dictionary term based MLIR.",
        "The first, raised by Hull et al. (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996), is that generating multiple translations breaks the term independence assumption of the vector space model.",
        "A second issue, identified by (Davis, 1996), is whether vector matching methods can succeed given that they essentially exploit linear (term-for-term) relations in the query and target document.",
        "This becomes important for languages such as English and Japanese where high-level transfer is necessary.",
        "Machine translation of the query on the other hand, uses high level analysis and should be able to resolve much of the lexical transfer ambiguity supplied by the bilingual dictionary, leading to significant improvements in performance over DTL, e.g. see (Davis, 1996).",
        "We assume that the MT system will select only one synonym where a choice exists so term independence in the vector space model is not a problem.",
        "Term transfer mistakes clearly depend on the quality of analysis, but may become a significant factor when the query contains only a few terms and little surrounding context.",
        "Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, no comparison has been attempted before between DTL and MT in MLIR.",
        "This may be due either to the unreliability of MT, or because queries in MLIR tend to be short phrases or single terms and MT is considered too challenging.",
        "In our application of article alignment, where the query contains sentences, it is both meaningful and important to compare the two methods."

        "The goal of news article alignment is the same as that in MLIR: we want to find relevant matching documents in the source language corpus collection for those queries in the target language corpus collection.",
        "The main characteristics which make news article alignment different to MLIR are:",
        "• Number of query terms - the number of terms in a query is very large compared to the usual III task; • Small search space - we can reduce the search to those documents within a fixed range of the publication date; • Free text retrieval - we cannot control the search vocabulary as is the case in some information retrieval systems; • High precision - is required because the quality of the bilingual knowledge which we can acquire is directly related to the quality of article alignment.",
        "We expect the end product of article alignment to be a noisy-parallel corpus.",
        "In contrast to clean-parallel texts we are just beginning to explore noisy-parallel texts as a serious option for corpus-based N LP, e.g. (Fung and McK-eown, 1996).",
        "Noisy-parallel texts are characterised by heavy reformatting at the translation stage, including large sections of untranslated text and textual reordering.",
        "Methods which seek to align single sentences are unlikely to succeed with noisy parallel texts and we seek to match whole documents rather than sentences before bilingual lexical knowledge acquisition.",
        "The search effort required to align individual documents is considerable and makes manual alignment both tedious and time consuming."
