        "As originally postulated, Centering Theory (CT) (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995)) accounts for references between adjacent units but is restricted to local reference (i.e., within segment boundaries).",
        "Recently, CT-based work has emerged which considers the relation of global discourse structure and anaphora, all of which proposes extensions to centering in order to apply it to global discourse.",
        "We approach the relationship between global structure and anaphora resolution from a different, but related, perspective.",
        "We identify domains of referential accessibility for each discourse unit over discourse structure trees such as those defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST ; Mann and Thompson (1987)) and show how CT can then be applied to global discourse by using these domains.",
        "As such, our approach differs from Walker's (1996), whose account of referentiality within the cache memory model does not rely on discourse structure, but rather on cue phrases and matching constraints together with constraints on the size of the cache imposed to reflect the plausible limits of the attentional span.",
        "Our approach is closer to that of Passonneau (1995) and Hahn and Striibe (1997), who both use a stack-based model of discourse structure based on Grosz and Sidner's (1986) focus spaces.",
        "Such a model is equivalent to a dynamic processing model of a treelike structure reflecting the hierarchical nesting of discourse segments, and thus has significant similarities to discourse structure trees produced by RST (see Moser and Moore (1996)).",
        "However, using the RST notion of nuclearity, we go beyond previous work by revealing a \"hidden\" structure in the discourse tree, which we call veins, that enables us to determine the referential accessibility domain for each discourse unit and ultimately to apply CT globally, without extensions to CT or additional data structures.",
        "In this paper, we describe Veins Theory (VT) by showing how veins are defined over discourse structure trees, and how CT can be applied to global discourse by using them.",
        "We use centering transitions (Brennan, Friedman and Pollard (1987)) to define a «smoothness» index, which is used to compare different discourse structures and interpretations.",
        "Because veins define the domains of referential access for each discourse unit, we further demonstrate how VT may be potentially used to determine the «minimal» parts of a text required to resolve references in a given utterance or, more generally, to understand it out of the context of the entire discourse.",
        "Finally, we validate our theory by analyzing examples from corpora of English, French, and Romanian."
