        "Our project's long-range goal (see http://www.isp.",

        "Our computational approach (Thomason and Hobbs, 1997) uses a form of weighted abduction as the reasoning mechanism (Hobbs et al., 1993) and modal operators to model context.",
        "In this paper, we describe the corpus study portion of our project, which is an integral part of our investigation into recognizing how conversational participants coordinate agreement.",
        "From our first annotation trials, we found that the recognition of \"classical\" speech acts (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1975) by coders is fairly reliable, while recognizing contextual relationships (e.g., whether an utterance accepts a proposal) is not as reliable.",
        "Thus, we explore other features that can help us recognize how participants coordinate agreement.",
        "Our corpus study also provides a preliminary assessment of the Discourse Resource Initiative (DRI) tagging scheme.",
        "The DRI is an international \"grassroots\" effort that seeks to share corpora that have been tagged with the core features of interest to the discourse community.",
        "In order to use the core scheme, it is anticipated that each group will need to refine it for their particular purposes.",
        "A usable draft core scheme is now available for experimentation (see http://www.georgetown.edu/luperfoy/DiscourseTreebank/dri-home.html).",
        "Whereas several groups are working with the unadapted core DRI scheme (Core and Allen, 1997; Poesio and Traum, 1997), we have attempted to adapt it to our corpus and particular research questions.",

        "Our corpus consists of 24 computer-mediated dialogues1 in which two participants collaborate on a simple task of buying furniture for the living and dining rooms of a house (a variant of the task in (Walker, 1993)).",
        "The participants' main goal is to negotiate purchases; the items of highest priority are a sofa for the living room and a table and four chairs for the dining room.",
        "The problem solving task is complicated by several secondary goals: 1) Match colors within a room, 2) Buy as much furniture as you can, 3) Spend all your money.",
        "A point system is used to motivate participants to try to achieve as many goals as possible.",
        "Each subject has a budget and inventory of furniture that lists the quantities, colors, and prices for each available item.",
        "By sharing this initially private information, the participants can combine budgets and select furniture from either's inventory.",
        "The problem is collaborative in that all decisions have to be consensual; funds are shared and purchasing decisions are joint.",
        "In this context, we characterize an agreement as accepting a partner's suggestion to include a specific furniture item in the solution.",
        "In this paper we will focus on the issue of recognizing that a suggestion has been made (i.e. a proposal).",

        "Our working hypothesis is that for both participants context is partly determined by the domain reasoning situation.",
        "Specifically, if the suitable courses of action are highly limited, this will make an utterance more likely to be treated as a proposal; this correlation is supported by our corpus analysis, as we will discuss in Section 5."

        "was Ui tagged as accepting, rejecting, or holding the same antecedent?' K factors out chance agreement between coders; K=0 means agreement is not different from chance, and K=1 means perfect agreement.",
        "To assess the import of the values 0 < K < 1 beyond K's statistical significance (all of our K values are significant at p=0.000005), the discourse processing community uses Krippendorf's scale (1980)5, which dis",
        "counts any variable with K < .67, and allows tentative conclusions when .67 < K < .8 K, and definite conclusions when K>.8.",

        "However, we have not yet done so for Agreement since our initial trial codings did not reveal strong disagreements; now given our K results, refinement is clearly needed.",
        "Another possible contributing factor for the low K on Agreement is that these tags are much rarer than the Forward Function tags.",
