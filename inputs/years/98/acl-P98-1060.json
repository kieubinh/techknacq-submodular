        "It is a central problem for any practical NLP system and specifically for any machine translation (MT) system to deal with ambiguity of natural language utterances.",
        "This is especially true for systems with large coverage grammars, where the number of potentially ambiguous descriptions grows drammatically as the number of acceptable syntactic constructions and the number of lexical readings increases.",
        "In general, it is not possible to resolve all potentially ambiguous descriptions without incorporating world knowledge of unlimited size.",
        "This fundamental problem has been discussed in the literaWe would like to thank our colleagues at Xerox PARC and Xerox RCE for fruitful discussions and the anonymous reviewers for valuable feedback.",
        "This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF) in the framework of the Verbmobil project under grant 01 IV 701 N3.",
        "ture as the Al completeness problem (cf. Kay et al.",
        "(1994)).",
        "Nevertheless, it has been observed that many ambiguous utterances in the source language (SL) text can be translated by equivalently ambiguous phrases in the target language (TL) text.",
        "We call such an ambiguity a preservable ambiguity and the corresponding architecture for translation an ambiguity preserving MT approach.",
        "In order to achieve this goal of ambiguity preserving translations there exist a number of different solutions we can apply.",
        "A naive solution would enumerate all possible ambiguous descriptions, translate them and generate the corresponding target utterances which would then be intersected to find a common string which covers all meanings.",
        "This strategy is obviously not feasible because the number of potential readings might grow exponentially with the length of the sentence.",
        "Another solution to overcome this problem is not to resolve ambiguities at all by using underspecified representations.",
        "This strategy has been successfully applied for a number of semantic ambiguities like quantifier and operator scope ambiguities.",
        "Therefore it is not surprising that the usage of underspecified semantic representations have gained much popularity in recent years.",
        "Work in the literature include the QLF representations (Alshawi, 1992), the work on Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRS) (Reyle, 1993; Bos et al., 1996), and the collection of papers in van Deemter and Peters (1996).",
        "For an application of using underspecified semantic representations within MT see Alshawi et al.",
        "(1991), Copestake et al.",
        "(1995) and Dorna and Emele (1996).",
        "Another source of ambiguities which might be preservable between related languages include syntactic ambiguities like the well-known PP at",
        "tachment ambiguities.",
        "There has been growing interest in developing underspecified or so called packed respresentations to deal with such syntactic ambiguities (cf. Rich et al.",
        "(1987), Seo and Simmons (1989), Bear and Hobbs (1988), Maxwell III and Kaplan (1993), Pinkal (1995), Egg and Lebeth (1995), Schiehlen (1996) and DOrre (1997)).",
        "The key idea of all these representations is to factor common information as much as possible in a parse forest and to represent the attachment ambiguities as local disjunctions without conversion to disjunctive normal form.",
        "Such representations avoid the exponential explosion which would result if all possible readings are extracted from the parse forest.",
        "To achieve our overall goal of ambiguity preserving MT it requires not only a parser which is able to produce such packed representations but also a generator which is able to take such a packed representation as input and generate all possible paraphrases without explicitly enumerating all readings.",
        "The work in Kay (1996) and the extension to ambiguous input in Shemtov (1996) and Shemtov (1997) describes a chart-based generation process which takes packed representations as input and generates all paraphrases without expanding first into disjunctive normal form.",
        "What needs to be done to realize our envisaged goal is a transfer system which is able to work on these packed translations without unpacking them or only as much as necessary if ambiguities can only partly be preserved in the target language.",
        "The rest of this paper is concerned with the extension of a Shake-and-Bake like transfer approach (Whitelock, 1992; Beaven, 1992) or the kind of semantic-based transfer approach as described for example in Dorna and Emele (1996) to cope with local ambiguities.",
        "To explain and illustrate the treatment of local ambiguities we show how an underspecified representation of PP attachment ambiguities can be utilized in a machine translation architecture for providing ambiguity preserving translations.",
        "It is illustrated on the basis of LFG f-structure level representations (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982).",
        "However, it could equally well be done on the level of underspecified semantic representations as shown in (Dorna et al., 1998).",
        "The main reason for choosing the f-structure level representation is due to the fact that we could use the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) system (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1996) for the analysis and generation of English and German utterances.",
        "The key argument for using this linguistic workbench is the ability to produce packed representations for ambiguous utterances using techniques described in Maxwell III and Kaplan (1993) and the availability of a generator which generates utterances from f-structure descriptions.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: first, we show how the hierarchical f-structure representations can be converted into a flat set of Prolog predicates such that the Shake-and-Bake like transfer approach can be applied.",
        "Second, we show how PP attachment ambiguities are represented using a packed representation.",
        "Then we show how this particular transfer approach can be adopted for dealing with this kind of ambiguous representations."
