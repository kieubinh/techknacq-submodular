        "We have presented the results of applying different disambiguation methods to an agglutinative and highly inflected language with a relatively free order in sentences.",
        "On one hand, this latter characteristic of Basque makes it difficult to learn appropriate probabilities, particularly first order stochastic models.",
        "We solve this problem in part with CG for Basque, which uses a larger context and can tackle the free word-order problem.",
        "However, it is a very hard work to write a full grammar and disambiguate texts completely using CO formalism, so we have complemented this method with a stochastic disambiguation process and the results are quite encouraging.",
        "Comparing the results of Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994) with ours, we see that they achieve 98.5% recall combining 1.02-1.04 readings from ENGCG and 96% accuracy in XT, while we begin with 1.13-1.14 readings, the quality of our stochastic tagger is less than 90% and our result is better than 96%.",
        "Unlike Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994), we think that training on the output of the CG the statistical disambiguation works quite betterlo, at least using such a small training corpus.",
        "In the future we will compile a larger corpus and to decrease the number of readings left by CG.",
        "On the other hand, we think that the information given by the second level tag is not sufficient to decide which of the choices is the correct one, but the training corpus is quite small.",
        "However, translating the results of the 3rd level to the 2nd one we obtain around 97% of accuracy.",
        "So, we think that improving the 3rd level tagging would improve the 2nd level tagging too.",
        "We also want to experiment unsupervised learning in the 3rd level tagging with a large training corpus.",
        "Along with this, the future research will focus on the following processes:",
        "• morphosyntactic treatment for the elaboration of morphological information (nominalisa-tion, ellipsis, etc.).",
        "• treatment of multiword lexical units (MWLU).",
