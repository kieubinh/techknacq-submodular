        "This paper describes a layered approach to information retrieval, and the natural language component that is a major element in that approach.",
        "The layered approach, packaged as IntermezzoTm , was deployed in a pre-product form at a government site.",
        "The NLP component has been installed, with a proprietary IR engine, PhotoFile, (Flank, Martin, Balogh and Rothey, 1995), (Flank, Garfield, and Norkin, 1995), at several commercial sites, including Picture Network International (PNI), Simon and Schuster, and John Deere.",
        "Intermezzo employs an abstraction layer to permit simultaneous querying of multiple databases.",
        "A user enters a query into a client, and the query is then passed to the server.",
        "The abstraction layer, part of the server, converts the query to the appropriate format for each of the databases (e.g. FulcrumTM, RetrievalWareTM, TopicTm, WAIS).",
        "In Boolean mode, queries are translated, using an SGML-based intermediate query language, into the appropriate form; in NLP mode the queries undergo morphological analysis, NP syntax, and semantic expansion before being converted for use by the databases.",
        "The following example illustrates how a user's query is translated.",
        "Unexpanded query natural disasters in New England Search-engine specific natural AND disaster(s) AND New AND England Semantic expansion ((natural and disaster(s)) or hurricane(s) or earthquake(s) or tornado(es) in (\"New England\" or Maine or Vermont or \"New Hampshire\" or \"Rhode Island\" or Connecticut or Massachusetts) The NLP component has been deployed with as many as 500,000 images, at Picture Network International (PNI).",
        "The original commercial use of PNI was as a dialup system, launched with approximately 100,000 images.",
        "PNI now operates on the World Wide Web (www.publishersdepot.com).",
        "Adjustment of the NLP component continued actively up through about 250,000 images, including additions to the semantic net and tuning of the parameters for weighting.",
        "Retrieval speed for the NLP component averages under a second.",
        "Semantic expansion is performed in advance on the caption database, not at runtime; runtime expansion makes operation too slow.",
        "The remainder of this paper describes how the NLP mode works, and what was required to create it."

      "text": [
        "The natural language processing techniques used in this system are well known, including in information retrieval applications (Strzalkowski, 1993), (Strzalkowski, Perez Carballo and Marinescu, 1995), (Evans and Zhai, 1996).",
        "The importance of this work lies in the scale and robustness of the techniques as combined into a system for querying large databases.",
        "The NLP component is also layered, in effect.",
        "It uses a conventional search algorithm (several were tested, and the architecture supports plug-and-play here).",
        "User queries undergo several types of NLP processing, detailed below, and each element in the processing contributes new query components (e.g. synonyms) and/or weights.",
        "The resulting query, as in the example above, natural disasters in New England, contains expanded terms and weighting information that can be passed to any search engine.",
        "Thus the Intermezzo multisearch layer can be seen",
        "as a natural extension of the layered design of the NLP search system.",
        "When texts (or captioned images) are loaded into the database, each word is looked up, words that may be related in the semantic net are found based on stored links, and the looked-up word, along with any related words, are all displayed as the \"expansion\" of that word.",
        "Then a check is made to determine whether the current word or phrase corresponds to a proper name, a location, or something else.",
        "If it corresponds to a name, a name expansion process is invoked that displays the name and related names such as nicknames and other variants, based on a linked name file.",
        "If the current word or phrase corresponds to a location, a location expansion process is invoked that, accessing a gazetteer, displays the location and related locations, such as Arlington, Virginia and Arlington, Massachusetts for Arlington, based on linked location information in the gazetteer and supporting files.",
        "If the current word or phrase is neither a name nor a location, it is expanded using the semantic net links and weights associated with those links.",
        "Strongly related concepts are given high weights, while more remotely related concepts receive lower weights, making them less exact matches.",
        "Thus, for a query on car, texts or captions containing car and automobile are listed highest, followed by those with sedan, coupe, and convertible, and then by more remotely related concepts such as transmission, hood, and trunk.",
        "Once the appropriate expansion is complete, the current.",
        "word or phrase is stored in an index database, available for use in searching as described below.",
        "Processing then returns to the next word or phrase in the text.",
        "Once a user query is received, it is tokenized so that it is divided into individual tokens, which may be single words or multiwords.",
        "For this process, a variation of conventional pattern matching is used.",
        "If a single word is recognized as matching a word that is part of a stored multiword, a decision on whether to treat the single word as part of a multiword is made based on the contents of the stored pattern and the input pattern.",
        "Stored patterns include not just literal words, but also syntactic categories (e.g. adjective, non-verb), semantic categories (e.g. nationality, government entity), or exact matches.",
        "If the input matches the stored pattern information, then it is interpreted as a multiword rather than independent words.",
        "A part-of-speech tagger then makes use of linguistic and statistical information to tag the parts of speech of incoming query portions.",
        "Only words that match by part of speech are considered to match, and if two or more parts of speech are possible for a particular word, it is tagged with both.",
        "After tagging, word affixes (i.e. suffixes) are stripped from query words to obtain a word root, using conventional inflectional morphology.",
        "If a word in a query is not known, affixes are stripped from the word one by one until a known word is found.",
        "Derivational morphology is not currently implemented.",
        "Processing then checks to determine whether the resulting word is a function word (closed-class) or content word (open-class).",
        "Function words are ignored.",
        "1 For content words, the related concepts for each sense of the word are retrieved from the semantic net.",
        "If the root word is unknown, the word is treated as a keyword, requiring an exact match.",
        "Multiwords are matched as a whole unit, and names and locations are identified and looked up in the separate name and location files.",
        "Next, noun phrases and other syntactic units are identified.",
        "An intermediate query is then formulated to match against the index database.",
        "Texts or captions that match queries are then returned, ranked, and displayed to the user, with those that match best being displayed at the top of the list.",
        "In the current system, the searching is implemented by first building a B-tree of ID lists, one for each concept in the text database.",
        "The ID lists have an entry for each object whose text contains a reference to a given concept.",
        "An entry consists of an object ID and a weight.",
        "The object ID provides a unique identifier and is a positive integer assigned when the object is indexed.",
        "The weight reflects the relevance of the concept to the object's text, and is a positive integer.",
        "To add an object to an existing index, the object ID and a weight are inserted into the ID list of every concept that is in any way relevant to the text.",
        "For searching, the ID lists of every concept in the query are retrieved and combined as specified by the query.",
        "Since ID lists contain IDs with weights in sorted order, determining existence and relevance of a match is simultaneous and fast, using only a small number of processor instructions per concept-object pair.",
        "The following sections treat the NLP issues in more detail."

      "text": [
        "Semantic expansion, based on VVordNet 1.4 (Miller et al., 1994), makes it possible, to retrieve words by synonyms, hypernyms, and other relations, not simply by exact matches.",
        "The expansion must be constrained, or precision will suffer drastically.",
        "The first constraint is part of speech: retrieve only those expansions that apply to the correct part of speech in context.",
        "A Church-style tagger (Church, 1988) 1 In a few cases, the loss of prepositions presents a problem.",
        "In practice, the problem is largely restricted to pictures showing unexpected relationships, e.g. a package under a table.",
        "Treating prepositions just like content works leads to odd partial matches (things under tables before other pictures of packages and tables, for example).",
        "The solution will involve an intermediate treatment of prepositions.",
        "marks parts of speech.",
        "Sense tagging is a further refinement: the algorithm first distinguishes between, e.g. crane as a noun versus crane as a verb.",
        "Once noun has been selected, further ambiguity still remains, since a crane can be either a bird or a piece of construction equipment.",
        "This additional disambiguation can be ignored, or it can be performed manually (impractical for large volumes of text and impractical for queries, at least for most users).",
        "It can also be performed automatically, based on a sense-tagged corpus.",
        "The semantic net used in this application incorporates information from a variety of sources besides WordNet; to some extent it was hand-tailored.",
        "Senses were ordered according to their frequency of occurrence in the first 150,000 texts used for retrieval, in this case photo captions consisting of one to three sentences each.",
        "WordNet 1.5 and subsequent releases have the senses ordered by frequency, so this step would not be necessary now.",
        "The top level of the semantic net splits into events and entities, as is standard for knowledge bases supporting natural language applications.",
        "There are approximately 100,000 entries, with several links for each entry.",
        "The semantic net supplies information about synonymy and hierarchical relations, as well as more sophisticated links, like part-of.",
        "The closest synonyms, like dangerous and perilous, are ranked most highly, while subordinate types, like skating and rollerblading, are next.",
        "More distant links, like the relation between shake hands and handshake, links between adjectives and nouns, e.g. dangerous and danger, and part-of links, e.g. brake and brake shoe, contribute lesser amounts to the rank and therefore yield a lower overall ranking.",
        "Each returned image has an associated weight, with 100 being a perfect match.",
        "Exact matches (disregarding inflectional morphology) rank 100.",
        "The system may be configured so that it does not return matches ranked below a certain threshold, say 50.",
        "Table 1 presents the weights currently in use for the various relations in WordNet.",
        "The depth figure indicates how many levels a particular relation is followed.",
        "Some relations, like hypernyms and per-tainyms, are clearly relevant for retrieval, while others, such as antonyms, are irrelevant.",
        "If the depth is zero, as with antonyms, the relation is not followed at all: it is not useful to include antonyms in the semantic expansion of a term.",
        "If the depth is non-zero, as with hypernyms, its relative weight is given in the weight figure.",
        "Hypernyms make sense for retrieval (animals retrieves hippos) but hyponyms do not (hippos should not retrieve animals).",
        "The weight indicates the degree to which each succeeding level is discounted.",
        "Thus a ladybug is rated 90% on a query for beetle, but only 81% (90% x 90%) on a query for insect, 73% (90% x 81%) on a query for arthropod, 66% (90% x 73%) on a query for invertebrate, 59% (90% x 66%) on a query for animal, and not at all",

        "• An amorphous amoeba speckled with greenish-yellow blobs.",
        "It might appear that ladybugs should be retrieved in queries for organism, but in fact such high-level queries generate thousands of hits even with only four-level expansion.",
        "In practical terms, then, the number of levels must be limited.",
        "Excal-ibur's WordNet-based retrieval product, Retrieval-Ware, does not limit expansion levels, instead allowing the expert user to eliminate particular senses of words at query time, in recognition of the need to limit term expansion in one aspect of the system if not in another.",
        "The depth and weight figures were tuned by trial and error on a corpus of several hundred thousand paragraph-length picture captions.",
        "For longer texts, the depth, particularly for hypernyms, should be less.",
        "The weights file does not affect which images are selected as relevant, but it does affect their relevance ranking, and thus the ordering that the user sees.",
        "In practical terms this means that for a query on animal, exact matches on animal appear first, and hippos appear before ladybugs.",
        "Of course, if the threshold is set at 50 and the weights alter a ranking from",
        "51 to 49, the user will no longer see that image in the list at all.",
        "Technically, however, the image has not been removed from the relevance list, but rather simply downgraded.",
        "WordNet was designed as a multifunction natural language resource, not as an IR expansion net.",
        "Inevitably, certain changes were required to tailor it for NLP-based IR.",
        "First, there were a few links high in the hierarchy that caused bizarre behavior, like animals being retrieved for queries including man or men.",
        "Other problems were some \"unusual\" correlations, such as:",
        "• grimace linked to smile • juicy linked to sexy",
        "Second, certain slang entries were inappropriate for a commercial system and had to be removed in order to avoid giving offense.",
        "Single sense words (e.g. crap) were not particularly problematic, since users who employed them in a query presumably did so on purpose.",
        "Polysemous terms such as nuts, skirt, and frog, however, were eliminated, since they could inadvertently cause offense.",
        "Third, there were low-level edits of single words.",
        "Before the senses were reordered by frequency, some senses were disabled in response to user feedback.",
        "These senses caused retrieval behavior that users found inexplicable.",
        "For example, the battle sense of engagement, the fervor sense of fire, and the Indian language sense of Massachusetts, all were removed, because they retrieved images that users could not link to the query.",
        "Although users were forgiving when they could understand why a bad match had occurred, they were far less patient with what they viewed as random behavior.",
        "In this case, the rarity of the senses made it difficult for users to trace the logic at work in the sense expansion.",
        "Finally, since language evolves so quickly, new terms had to be added, e.g. rollerblade.",
        "This task was the most common and the one requiring the least expertise.",

        "Oddly enough, they are quite willing to make excuses for bad system behavior, explaining away implausible matches, once they have been convinced of the system's basic accuracy.",
        "The customers rarely test recall, since it is rare either for them to know which pictures are available or to enter successive related queries and compare the match sets.",
        "Complaints about recall in the initial stages of system development came from suppliers, who wanted to ensure their own pictures could be retrieved reliably.",
        "To test recall as well as precision in a controlled environment, in the early phase of development, a test set of 1200 images was created, and manually matched, by a photo researcher, against queries submitted by other photo researchers.",
        "The process was time-consuming and frustratingly imprecise: it was difficult to score, since matches can be partial, and it was hard to determine how much credit to assign for, say, a 70% match that seemed more like a 90% match to the human researcher.",
        "Precision tests on the live (500,000-image) PNI system were much easier to evaluate, since the system was more likely to have the images requested.",
        "For example, while a database containing no little girls in red shirts will offer up girls with any kind of shirt and anything red, a comprehensive database will bury those imperfect matches beneath the more highly ranked, more accurate matches.",
        "Ultimately, precision was tested on 50 queries on the full system; any bad match, or partial match if ranked above a more complete match, was counted as a miss, and only the top 20 images were rated.",
        "Recall was tested on a 50-image subset created by limiting such non-NLP criteria as image orientation and photographer.",
        "Precision was 89.6% and recall was 92%.",
        "In addition, precision was tested by comparing query results for each new feature added (e.g. \"Does noun phrase syntax do us any good?",
        "What rankings work best?\"",
        ").",
        "It was also tested by series of related queries, to test, for example, whether penguins swimming retrieved the same images as swimming penguins.",
        "Recall was tested by more related queries and for each new feature, and, more formally, in comparison to keyword searches and to Excal-ibur's RetrievalWare.",
        "Major testing occurred when the database contained 30,000 images, and again at 150,000.",
        "At 150,000, one major result was that WordNet senses were rearranged so that they were in frequency order based on the senses hand-tagged by captioners for the initial 150,000 images.",
        "In one of our retrieval tests, the combination of noun phrase syntax and name recognition improved recall by 18% at a fixed precision point.",
        "While we have not yet attempted to test the two capabilities separately, it does appear that name recognition played a larger role in the improvement than did noun phrase syntax.",
        "This is in accord with previous literature on the contributions of noun phrase syntax (Lewis, 1992), (Lewis and Croft, 1990)."

        "Nonetheless, since each corpus includes over 20,000 pictures, there should be enough data to provide interesting comparisons, even at this preliminary stage.",
        "Certain other measures have been taken to ensure that the test is as useful as possible within the constraints given; these are described below.",
        "Results are consistent with those shown in Voorhees (1994).",
        "Only precision is measured here, since the principal effect of tagging is on precision: untagged irrelevant captions are likely to show up in the results, but lack of tagging will not cause correct matches to be missed.",
        "Only crossing matches are scored as bad.",
        "That is, if Match 7 is incorrect, but Match 8, 9 and 10 are correct, then the score is 90% precision.",
        "If, on the other hand, Match 7 is incorrect and Matches 8, 9 and 10 are also incorrect, there is no precision penalty, since we want and expect partial matches to follow the good matches.",
        "Only the top ten matches are scored.",
        "There are three reasons for this: first, scoring hundreds or thousands of matches is impractical.",
        "Second, in actual usage, no one will care if Match 322 is better than Match 321, whereas incongruities in the top ten will matter very much.",
        "Third, since the threshold is set at 50%, some of the matches are by definition only \"half right.\"",
        "Raising the threshold would increase perceived precision but provide less insight about system performance.",
        "Eleven queries scored better in the sense-tagged corpus, while only two scored better in the untagged corpus.",
        "The remainder scored the same in both corpora.",
        "In terms of precision, the sense-tagged corpus scored 99% while the untagged corpus scored 89% (both figures are artificially inflated, but in parallel, since only crossing matches are scored as bad)."
