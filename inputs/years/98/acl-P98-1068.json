        "In natural language processing for Japanese text, morphological analysis is very important.",

        "The corpus-based method is popular for European languages.",
        "Samuelsson and Voutilainen (1997), however, show significantly higher achievement of a rule-based tagger than that of statistical taggers for English text.",
        "On the other hand, most Japanese taggers1 are rule-based.",
        "In previous Japanese taggers, it was difficult to increase the accuracy of the analysis.",

        "However, this increase is still insufficient.",
        "The source of the trouble is the difficulty in adjusting the grammar and parameters.",
        "Our tagger is also rule-based.",
        "By using the co-occurrence of words, it reduces the difficulty and generates a continuous increase in its accuracy.",
        "The proposed system analyzes unsegmented Japanese sentences and segments them into words.",
        "Each word has a part-of-speech and phonological representation.",
        "Our tagger has the co-occurrence information of words in its dictionary.",
        "The information can be adjusted concretely by hand in each case of incorrect analysis.",
        "Concrete adjustment is different from detailed adjustment.",
        "It must be easy to understand for people who make adjustments to the system.",
        "The effect of one adjustment is concrete but small.",

      "text": [
        "Most Japanese morphological analyzers use linguistic grammar, generate possible sequences of words from an input string, and select a sequence.",
        "The following are methods for selecting the sequence:",
        "• Choose the sequence that has a longer word on the right-hand side.",
        "(right longest match principle)",
        "• Choose the sequence that has a longer word on the left-hand side.",
        "(left longest match principle) • Choose the sequence that has the least number of phrases.",
        "(least number of phrases principle) • Choose the sequence that has the least connective-cost of words.",
        "(least connective-cost principle) • Use pattern matching of words and/or parts-of-speech to specify the priority of sequences.",
        "• Choose the sequence that contains modifiers and modifiees.",
        "• Choose the sequence that contains words used frequently.",
        "In practice, combinations of the above methods are used.",
        "Using these methods, many Japanese morphological analyzers have been created.",
        "However, the accuracy cannot increase continuously in spite of careful manual adjustments and statistical adjustments.",
        "The cause of incorrect analyses is not only unregistered words, in fact, many sentences are analyzed incorrectly even though there is a sufficient vocabulary for the sentences in their dictionaries.",
        "In this case, the system generates a correct sequence but does not select it.",
        "Parameters such as the priorities of words and connective-costs between parts-of-speech, can be adjusted so that the correct sequence is selected.",
        "However, this adjustment often causes incorrect side effects and the system analyzes other sentences incorrectly that have already been analyzed correctly.",
        "This phenomenon is called 'degrading'.",
        "In addition to parameter adjustment, parts-of-speech may need to be expanded.",
        "Both operations are almost impossible to complete by people who are not very familiar with the system.",
        "If the system uses a complex algorithm to select a sequence of words, even the system developer can hardly grasp the behaviour of the system.",
        "These operations begin to become more than what a few experts can handle because vocabularies in the systems are big.",
        "Even to add an unregistered word to a dictionary, operators must have good knowledge of parts-of-speech, the priorities of words, and word classification for modifiers and modifiees.",
        "In this situation, it is difficult to increase the number of operators.",
        "This is situation with previous analyzers.",
        "Unfortunately, current statistical taggers cannot avoid this situation.",
        "The tuning of the systems is very subtle.",
        "It is hard to predict the effect of parameter tuning of the systems.",
        "To avoid this situation, our tagger uses the co-occurrence of words whose effect is easy to understand."
