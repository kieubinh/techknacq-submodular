        "A number of resources are available for obtaining subcategorization information, i.e. information on the types of syntactic complements associated with valence-bearing predicators (which include verbs, nouns, and adjectives).",
        "This information, also referred to as valence information is available both in machine-readable form, as in the COMLEX database (Macleod et al.",
        "1995), and in human-readable dictionaries (e.g. Hornby 1989, Procter 1978, Sinclair 1987).",
        "Increasingly, tools are also becoming available for acquiring subcategorization information from corpora, i.e. for inferring the subcategorization frames of a given lemma (e.g. Manning 1993).",
        "None of these resources provide immediate access to corpus evidence, nor do they provide information on the relative frequency of the patterns that are listed for a given lemma.",

        "frames often list expected patterns, rather than actual ones.",
        "Lexicographers and lexicologist need access to the evidence for this information.",
        "3.",
        "Frequency information has come to be the focus of much psycholinguistic research on sentence processing (see for example MacDonald 1997).",
        "While information on word frequency is readily available (e.g. Francis and Kucera (1982)), there is as yet no easy way of obtaining information from large corpora on the relative frequency of complementation patterns.",
        "None of these points argue against the usefulness of the available resources, but they show that there is a gap in the available information.",
        "To address this need, we have developed a tool for extracting evidence for subcategorization patterns from the 100 mio.",
        "word British National Corpus (BNC).",

        "During the first stage, syntactic patterns involving 'displaced' arguments (i.e. 'left isolation' or 'movement' phenomena) are extracted, such as passives, tough movement and constructions involving WH-extraction.",
        "The result of this procedure is a set of subcorpora that are homogeneous with respect to major constituent order.",
        "Following this, the remainder of the lemma-subcorpus is partitioned into subcorpora based on the subcategorization properties of the lemma in question.",

        "'no, said he', \"no\", 'he said', 'he said: \"no\" 'behave badly'",
        "For the extraction of certain subcategorization patterns, it is not necessary to simulate a parse of all of the constituents.",
        "Where an explicit context cue exists, a partial parse suffices.",
        "For example, the query given in figure 2 below is used to find [_ NP VPing] patterns (e.g. kept them laughing).",
        "Note that the query does not positively identify a noun phrase in the osition following the target verb.",
        "Applying queries like the one for [NP VPing] \"blindly\", i.e. in the absence of any information on the target lemma, would produce many false hits, since the query also matches gerunds that are not subcategorized.",
        "However, the information that the target verb subcategorizes for a gerund dramatically reduces the number of such errors.",
        "The same mechanism is used for addressing the problems associated with prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "The general principle is that prepositional phrases in certain contexts are considered to be embedded in a preceding noun phrase , unless the user specifies that a given preposition is subcategorized for by the target lemma.",
        "For example, the of-phrase in a sequence Verb - NP - of - NP is interpreted as part of the first NP (as in met the president of the company), unless we are dealing with a verb that has a [_NP PPoi] subcategorization frame, e.g. cured the president of his asthma.",
        "The result of each query is subtracted from the lemma subcorpus and the remainder submitted to the next set of queries.",
        "As a result, earlier queries preempt later queries.",
        "For example, concordance lines matching the queries for passives, e.g. he was cured of his asthma are filtered out early on in the process, so as to avoid getting matched by the queries dealing with (active intransitive) verb + prepositional phrase complements, such as he boasted of his achievements.",
        "Another example of this type of preemption concerns the interaction of the query for ditransitive frames (brought her flowers) with later queries for NP complements.",
        "A proper name immediately followed by another proper name (e.g. Henry James) is interpreted as a single noun phrase except when the target lemma subcategorizes for a ditransitive frame'.",
        "An analogous strategy is used for identifying noun compounds.",
        "For ditransitives, strings that represent two consecutive noun phrases are queried for first.",
