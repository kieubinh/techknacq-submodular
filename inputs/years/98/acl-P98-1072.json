        "In both cases, the syntactic configu-rational information for German supports the preferred scoping: the operator with the widest scope is c-commanding the operator with narrow scope.",
        "Preserving the suggested scope resolution restrictions from the source language would be necessary for a correct interpretation.",
        "However, the configurational restrictions do not easily carry over to English; there is no verb movement in the English sentence of (2), so 'not' does not c-command 'can' in this case.",

        "The aim of VIT is to describe a consistent interface structure between the different language analysis modules within Verbmobil.",

        "Utterances with more than two ambiguities (> 5 holes) are rare and have been grouped together.",

        "Looking closer at these cases, the reasons for the failures divide as: the relative scope of two particles did not conform to the c-command structure assigned by syntax (one case); an indefinite noun phrase should have received wide scope (3), or narrow scope (1); an adverb should have had wide scope (3); combination of (a modal) verb movement and negated question (1); technical construction problem in VIT (4).",
