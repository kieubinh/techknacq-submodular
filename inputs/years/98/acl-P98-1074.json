        "Early works, (Gale and Church, 1993; Brown et al., 1993), and to a certain extent (Kay and ROscheisen, 1993), presented methods to extract 1-)lingual lexicons of words from a parallel corpus, relying on the distribution of the words in the set of parallel sentences (or other units).",
        "(Brown et al., 1993) then extended their method and established a sound probabilistic model series, relying on different parameters describing how words within parallel sentences are aligned to each other.",
        "On the other hand, (Dagan et al., 1993) proposed an algorithm, borrowed to the field of dynamic programming and based on the output of their previous work, to find the best alignment, subject to certain constraints, between words in parallel sentences.",
        "A similar algorithm was used by (Vogel et al., 1996).",

        "pruning what (Melamed, 1996) calls \"indirect associations\".",
        "Now, what differentiates the models and algorithms proposed are the sets of parameters and constraints they rely on, their ability to find an appropriate solution under the constraints defined and their ability to nicely integrate new parameters.",
        "We want to present here a model of the possible alignments in the form of flow networks.",
        "This representation allows to define different kinds of alignments and to find the most probable or an approximation of this most probable alignment, under certain constraints.",
        "Our procedure presents the advantage of an accurate modelling of the possible alignments, and can be used on small corpora.",
        "We will introduce this model in the next section.",
        "Section 3 describes a particular use of this model to find term translations, and presents the results we obtained for this task on a small corpus.",

        "• V comprises a source, a sink, all the English and French words, an empty English word, and an empty French word, • E comprises edges from the source to all the English words (including the empty one), edges from all the French words (including the empty one) to the sink, an edge from the sink to the source, and edges from all English words (including the empty one) to all the French words (including the empty one)2.",
        "• from the source to all possible English words (excluding the empty one), the capacity interval is [1;1],",

        "Once such a graph has been defined, we have to assign cost values to its edges, to reflect the different association probabilities.",

        "Let a be an alignment, under the above constraints, between the English sentence es, and the French sentence f5.",
        "Such an alignment a can be seen as a particular relation from the set of English words with their positions, including empty words, to the set of French words with their positions, including empty words (in our framework, it is formally equivalent to consider a single empty word with larger upper capacity bound or several ones with smaller upper capacity bounds; for the sake of simplicity in the formulas, we consider here that we add as many empty words as necessary in the sentences to end up with two sentences containing le + lj words).",
        "An alignment thus connects each English word, located in position i, ei, to a French word, in position j, h. We consider that the probability of such a connection depends on two distinct and independent probabilities, the one of linking two positions, p(ap(i) = ai), and the one of linking two words, p(a,,(ei) = fej).",

        "Wire can use the following general algorithm based on maximum likelihood under the maximum approximation, to estimate the parameters of our model:",
        "1. set some initial value to the different parameters of the model, 2. for each sentence pair in the corpus, compute the best alignment (or an approximation of this alignment) between words, with respect to the model, and update the counts of the different parameters with respect to this alignment (the maximum likelihood estimators for model free distributions are based on relative frequencies, conditioned by the set of best alignments in our case), 3. go back to step 2 till an end condition is reached.",
        "This algorithm converges after a few iterations.",
        "Here, we have to be carefull with step 1.",
        "In particular, if we consider at the beginning of the process all the possible alignments to be equiprobable, then all the feasible flows are minimal cost flows.",
        "To avoid this situation, we have to start with initial probabilities which make use of the fact that some associations, occurring more often in the corpus, should have a larger probability.",
        "Probabilities based on relative frequencies, or derived from the measure defined in (Dunning, 1993), for example, allow to take this fact into account.",
        "We can envisage more complex models, including distortion parameters, multiword notions, or information on part-of-speech, information derived from bilingual dictionaries or from thesauri.",
        "The integration of new parameters is in general straigthforward.",

        "These remarks lead us to advocate a mixed model, where candidate terms are identified in English and where their French correspondent is searched for.",

        "To solve ambiguous associations, we simply replace each association of type 2 or 3 by the equivalent type 1 association3.",
