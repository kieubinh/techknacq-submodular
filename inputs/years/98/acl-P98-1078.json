        "Separable verbs are verbs with prefixes which, depending on the syntactic context, can occur as one word written together or discontinuously.",
        "They occur in languages such as German and Dutch and constitute a problem for NLP because they are lexemes whose forms cannot always be recognized by dictionary lookup on the basis of a text word.",
        "Conventional solutions take a mixed lexical and syntactic approach.",
        "In this paper, we propose the solution offered by Word Manager, consisting of string-based recognition by means of rules of types also required for periphrastic inflection and clitics.",
        "In this way, separable verbs are dealt with as part of the domain of reusable lexical resources.",
        "We show how this solution compares favourably with conventional approaches."

        "In German there exists a large class of verbs which behave like aufhOren ('stop'), illustrated in (1).",
        "(1) a. Anna glaubt, dass Bernard aufhOrt.",
        "(`Anna believes that Bernard stops') b. Claudia hOrt jetzt auf.",
        "('Claudia stops now PRT') c. Daniel versucht aufzuhOren.",
        "('Daniel tries to_stop') In subordinate clauses as in (la), the particle auf and the inflected part of the verb hOrt are written together.",
        "In main clauses such as (lb), the inflected form hOrt is moved by verb-second, leaving the particle stranded.",
        "In infinitive clauses with the particle zu ('to'), zu separates the two components of the verb and all three elements are written together.",
        "In analysis, the problem of separable verbs is to combine the two parts of the verb in contexts such as (lb) and (lc).",
        "Such a combination is necessary because syntactic and semantic properties of aufhOren are the same, irrespective of whether the two parts are written together or not, but they cannot be deduced from the syntactic and semantic properties of the parts.",
        "Therefore, a solution to the problem of separable verbs will treat (lb) as if it read (2a) and (lc) as (2b):",
        "(2) a. Claudia aufhOrt jetzt.",
        "b. Daniel versucht zu aufhOren.",
        "The problem arises in a very similar fashion in Dutch, as the Dutch translations (3) of the sentences in (1) show.",
        "The only difference is that the infinitive in (3c) is not written together.",
        "(3) a. Anna gelooft dat Bernard ophoudt.",
        "b. Claudia houdt nu op.",
        "c. Daniel probeert op te houden.",
        "On the other hand, the problem of separable verbs in German and Dutch differs from the corresponding one in English, because English verbs such as look up are multi-word units in all contexts.",
        "A treatment of these cases which is in line with the solution proposed here is described by Tschichold (forthcoming).",
        "As suggested by the English translation, separable verbs in German and Dutch are lexemes.",
        "Therefore, an important issue in evaluating a mechanism for dealing with them is how it fits in with the reusability of lexical resources.",
        "Given the importance of the orthographic component in the problem, it is not surprising that it is hardly if ever treated in the linguistic literature."

        "In existing systems or resources for NLP, separable verbs are usually treated as a lexicographic and syntactic problem.",
        "Two typical approaches can be illustrated on the basis of Celex and Rosetta.",
        "Celex (http://www.kun.nl/celex) is a lexical database project offering a German dictionary with 50000 entries and a Dutch dictionary with 120'000 entries.",
        "In these dictionaries separable verbs are listed with a feature conveying the information that they belong to the class of separable verbs and a bracketing structure showing the decomposition into a prefix and a base, e.g. (auf)(hOren).",
        "Celex dictionaries are reusable, but the rule component for the interpretation of the information on separable verbs, i.e. the mechanism for going from (lb-c) to (2), remains to be developed by each NLP-system using the dictionaries.",
        "Rosetta is a machine translation system which includes Dutch as one of the source and target languages.",
        "Rosetta (1994:78-79) describes how separable verbs are treated.",
        "For the verb ophouden illustrated in (3), there are three lexical entries, ophouden for the continuous forms as in (3a), and houden and op for the discontinuous forms as in (3b-c).",
        "When a form of houden is found in a text, it is multiply ambiguous, because it can be a form of the simple verb houden ('hold') or of one of the separable verbs ophouden ('stop'), aanhouden ('arrest'), afhouden ('withhold'), etc.",
        "The entry for houden as part of ophouden contains the information •that it must be combined with a particle op.",
        "At the same time, op is ambiguous between a reading as preposition or particle.",
        "In syntax, there is a rule combining the two elements in a sentence such as (3b).",
        "It is clear that, while this approach may work, it is far from elegant.",
        "It creates ambiguity and redundancies, because ophouden written together is treated in a different entry from op + houden as a discontinuous unit.",
        "These properties make the resulting dictionaries less transparent and do not favour reusability.",
        "It should be pointed out that Celex and Rosetta were not chosen because their solution to the problem of separable verbs is worse than others.",
        "They are representative examples of currently used strategies, chosen mainly because they are relatively well-documented."
