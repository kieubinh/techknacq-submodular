        "The approach to learning new concepts as a result of understanding natural language texts we present here builds on two different sources of evidence – the prior knowledge of the domain the texts are about, and grammatical constructions in which unknown lexical items occur.",
        "While there may be many reasonable interpretations when an unknown item occurs for the very first time in a text, their number rapidly decreases when more and more evidence is gathered.",
        "Our model tries to make explicit the reasoning processes behind this learning pattern.",
        "Unlike the current mainstream in automatic linguistic knowledge acquisition, which can be characterized as quantitative, surface-oriented bulk processing of large corpora of texts (Hin-dle, 1989; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Hearst, 1992; Manning, 1993), we propose here a knowledge-intensive model of concept learning from few, positive-only examples that is tightly integrated with the non-learning mode of text understanding.",
        "Both learning and understanding build on a given core ontology in the format of terminological assertions and, hence, make abundant use of terminological reasoning.",
        "The 'plain' text understanding mode can be considered as the instantiation and continuous filling",
        "of roles with respect to single concepts already available in the knowledge base.",
        "Under learning conditions, however, a set of alternative concept hypotheses has to be maintained for each unknown item, with each hypothesis denoting a newly created conceptual interpretation tentatively associated with the unknown item.",
        "The underlying methodology is summarized in Fig. 1.",
        "The test parser (for an overview, cf.",
        "Broker et al.",
        "(1994)) yields information from the grammatical constructions in which an unknown lexical item (symbolized by the black square) occurs in terms of the corresponding dependency parse tree.",
        "The kinds of syntactic constructions (e.g., genitive, apposition, comparative), in which unknown lexical items appear, are recorded and later assessed relative to the credit they lend to a particular hypothesis.",
        "The conceptual interpretation of parse trees involving unknown lexical items in the domain knowledge base leads to the derivation of concept hypotheses, which are further enriched by conceptual annotations.",
        "These reflect structural patterns of consistency, mutual justification, analogy, etc.",
        "relative to already available concept descriptions in the domain knowledge base or other hypothesis spaces.",
        "This kind of initial evidence, in particular its predictive \"goodness\" for the learning task, is represented by corresponding sets of linguistic and conceptual (pal",
        "ity labels.",
        "Multiple concept hypotheses for each unknown lexical item are organized in terms of corresponding hypothesis spaces, each of which holds different or further specialized conceptual readings.",
        "The quality machine estimates the overall credibility of single concept hypotheses by taking the available set of quality labels for each hypothesis into account.",
        "The final computation of a preference order for the entire set of competing hypotheses takes place in the qualifier, a terminological classifier extended by an evaluation metric for quality-based selection criteria.",
        "The output of the quality machine is a ranked list of concept hypotheses.",
        "The ranking yields, in decreasing order of significance, either the most plausible concept classes which classify the considered instance or more general concept classes subsuming the considered concept class (cf. Schnattinger and Hahn (1998) for details)."

        "Whenever, e.g., two nominals or a nominal and a verb are supposed to be syntactically related in the regular parsing mode, the semantic interpreter simultaneously evaluates the conceptual compatibility of the items involved.",
        "Since these reasoning processes are fully embedded in a terminological representation system, checks are made as to whether a concept denoted by one of these objects is allowed to fill a role of the other one.",
        "If one of the items involved is unknown, i.e., a lexical and conceptual gap is encountered, this interpretation mode generates initial concept hypotheses about the class membership of the unknown object, and, as a consequence of inheritance mechanisms holding for concept taxonomies, provides conceptual role information for the unknown item.",
        "Given the structural foundations of terminological theories, two dimensions of conceptual learning can be distinguished – the taxonomic one by which new concepts are located in conceptual hierarchies, and the aggregational one by which concepts are supplied with clusters of conceptual relations (these will be used subsequently by the terminological classifier to determine the current position of the item to be learned in the taxonomy).",
        "In the following, let target.con be an unknown concept denoted by the corresponding lexical item tar-get.les, base.con be a given knowledge base concept denoted by the corresponding lexical item base.lex, and let target.lex and base.lex be related by some dependency relation.",

        "Generalizing from these considerations, we state a second hypothesis generation rule which accounts for aggregational patterns of concept learning.",
        "The basic assumption behind this rule, perm-hypo (cf. Table 5), is that target .con fills (exactly) one of the n roles of base.con it is currently permitted to fill (this set is determined by the function perm-filler).",
        "Depending on the actual linguistic construction one encounters, it may occur, in particular for PP and NP constructions, that one cannot decide on the correct role yet.",
        "Consequently, several alternative hypothesis spaces are opened and target.con is assigned as a potential filler of the i-th role (taken from ?roleSet, the set of admitted roles) in its corresponding hypothesis space.",

        "As for sub-hypo, perm-hypo assigns a syntactic quality label (function add-label) to each i-th hypothesis indicating the type of syntactic construction in which target.lex and base.lex are related in the text, e.g., CASEFRAME, PPAT-TACH or GENITivENP.",
        "Getting back to our example, let us assume that the target Itoh-Ci-8 is predicted already as a PRODUCT as a result of preceding interpretation processes, i.e., Itoh-Ci-8 : PRODUCT holds.",
