        "It has long been recognized that the possibility and preference rankings of scope readings depend to a great degree on the position of scope-taking elements in the surface string (Chomsky, 1975; Hobbs and Shieber, 1987).",
        "Yet most traditional accounts of semantic scopal phenomena in natural language have not directly tied these two factors together.",
        "Instead, they allow only certain derivations to link the surface structure of a sentence with the representational level at which scope relations are determined, place constraints upon the semantic feature-passing mechanism, or otherwise emulate a constraint which requires some degree of congruence between the surface syntax of a sentence and its preferred scope reading(s).",
        "A simpler and more direct approach is suggested by constraint-based, multistratal theories of grammar (Grimshaw, 1997; Jackendoff, 1997; Sadock, 1991; Van Valin, 1993).",
        "In these models, it is possible to posit multiple representational levels for a sentence without according ontological primacy to any one of them, as in all varieties of transformational grammar.",
        "This allows constraints to be formulated which place limits on structural discrepancies between levels, yet need not be assimilated into an overriding derivational mechanism.",
        "This paper will examine the model of one of these theories, Autolexical Grammar (Sadock, 1991; Sadock, 1996; Schiller et al., 1996), as it is implemented in a computational scope generator and critic.",
        "This left-corner chart parser generates surface syntactic structures for each sentence (as the only level of syntactic representation), as well as Function-Argument semantic structures and Quantifier/Operator-Scope structures.",
        "These latter two structures together determine the semantic interpretation of a sentence.",
        "It will be shown that this model is both categorical enough to handle standard generalizations about quantifier scope, such as bans on extraction from certain domains, and fuzzy enough to present reasonable preference rankings among scopings and account for lexical differences in quantifier strength (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988)."

        "Semantic, syntactic, morphological, discourse-functional and many other hierarchies have been introduced in the literature, but this project focuses on the interactions among only three major hierarchies: Surface Syntax, Function-Argument Structure,",
        "and Operator Scope Structure.",
        "The surface syntactic hierarchy is a feature-based grammar expressing those generalizations about a sentence which are most clearly syntactic in nature, such as agreement, case, and syntactic valency.",
        "The function-argument hierarchy expresses that (formal) semantic information about a sentence which does not involve scope resolution, e.g., semantic valency and association of referential terms with argument positions, as in Park (1995).",
        "The operator scope hierarchy, naturally, imposes a scope ordering on the quantifiers and operators found in the expression.",
        "Two other, minor hierarchies are employed in this implementation.",
        "The linear ordering of words in the surface string is treated as a hierarchy, and a lexical hierarchy is introduced in order to express the differing lexical \"strength\" of quantifiers.",
        "Each hierarchy can be represented as a tree in which the terminal nodes are not ordered with respect to one another.",
        "This implies that, for example, [John [saw Mary]] and [Mary [saw John]] will both be acceptable syntactic representations for the surface string Mary saw John.",
        "The optimal set of hierarchies for a string consists of the candidate hierarchies for each level of representation which together are most structurally congruous.",
        "The structural similarity between hierarchies is determined in Autolexical Grammar by means of an Alignment Constraint, which in the implementation described here counts the number of overlapping constituents in the two trees.",
        "Thus, while structures similar to [Mary [saw John]] and [John [saw Mary]] will both be acceptable as syntactic and function-argument structure representations, the alignment constraint will strongly favor a pairing in which both hierarchies share the same representation.",
        "Structural hierarchies are additionally evaluated by means of a Contiguity Constraint, which requires that the terminal nodes of each constituent of a hierarchy should be together in the surface string, or at least as close together as possible."

        "The main constraints which this model places on the relative scope of quantifiers and operators are the alignment of the operator scope hierarchy with syntax, function-argument structure, and the lexical hierarchy of quantifier strength.",
        "The first of these constraints reflects \"the principle that left-to-right order at the same syntactic level is preserved in the quantifier order\" and accounts for syntactic extraction restrictions.",
        "The second will favor operator scope structures in which scope-taking elements are raised as little as possible from their base argument positions.",
        "The last takes account of the scope preferences of individual quantifiers, such as the fact that each tends to have wider scope than all other quantifiers (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988).",
        "As an example of the sort of syntactically-based restrictions on quantifier ordering which this model can implement, consider the generalization listed in Moran (1988), that \"a quantifier cannot be raised across more than one major clause boundary.\" Because the approach pursued here already has a general constraint which penalizes candidate parses according to the degree of discrepancy between their syntax and scope hierarchies, we do not need to accord a privileged theoretical status to \"major clause boundaries.\" Figure 1 illustrates the approximate optimal structure accorded to the sentence Some patients believe all doctors are competent on the syntactic and scopal hierarchies, in which an extracted quantifier crosses one major clause boundary.",
        "It will be given a misalignment index of 4 (considering for the moment only the interaction of these two levels), because of the four overlapping constituents on the two hierarchies.",
        "This example would be misaligned only to degree 2 if the other quantifier order were chosen, and depending on the exact sentence type considered, an example with a scope-taking element crossing two major clause boundaries should be misaligned to about degree 8.",
        "The fact that the difference between the primary and secondary scopings of this sentence is 2 degrees of alignment, while the difference between crossing one clause boundary and two clause boundaries is 4 degrees of alignment, corresponds with generally accepted assumptions about the acceptability of this example.",
        "While the reading in which the scope of quantifiers mirrors their order in surface structure is certainly preferred, the other ordering is possible as well.",
        "If the extraction crosses another clause 'Hobbs and Shieber (1987), p. 49",

        "By introducing a lexical hierarchy of quantifier strength, in which those elements more likely to take wide scope are found higher in the tree, we are able to use the same mechanism of the alignment constraint to model the facts which other approaches treat with stipulative heuristics.",
        "For example, in Some patient paid each doctor, the preferred reading is the one in which each takes wide scope, contrary to our expectations based on the generalization that the primary scoping tends to mirror surface syntactic order.",
        "An approach employing some variant of Cooper storage would have to account for this by assigning to each pair of quantifiers a likelihood that one will be raised past the other.",
