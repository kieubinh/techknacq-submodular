        "There are many advantages to expressing a grammar in a lexicalized form, where an observable word of the language is encoded in each grammar rule.",
        "First, the lexical words help to clarify ambiguities that cannot be resolved by the sentence structures alone.",
        "For example, to correctly attach a prepositional phrase, it is often necessary to consider the lexical relationships between the head word of the prepositional phrase and those of the phrases it might modify.",
        "Second, lexicalizing the grammar rules increases computational efficiency because those rules that do not contain any observed words can be pruned away immediately.",
        "The Lexicalized Tree Insertion Grammar formalism (LTIG) has been proposed as a way to lexicalize context-free grammars (Schabes * This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.",
        "IRI 9712068.",
        "We thank Yves Schabes and Stuart Shieber for their guidance; Joshua Goodman for his PCFG code; Lillian Lee and the three anonymous reviewers for their comments on the paper.",
        "and Waters, 1994).",
        "We now apply a probabilistic variant of this formalism, Probabilistic Tree Insertion Grammars (PLTIGs), to natural language processing problems of stochastic parsing and language modeling.",
        "This paper presents two sets of experiments, comparing PLTIGs with non-lexicalized Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) and non-hierarchical N-gram models that use the right branching bracketing heuristics (period attaches high) as their parsing strategy.",
        "We show that PLTIGs can be induced from partially bracketed data, and that the resulting trained grammars can parse unseen sentences and estimate the likelihood of their occurrences in the language.",
        "The experiments are run on two corpora: the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus and a subset of the Wall Street Journal TreeBank corpus.",
        "The results show that the lexicalized nature of the formalism helps our induced PLTIGs to converge faster and provide a better language model than PCFGs while maintaining comparable parsing qualities.",
        "Although N-gram models still slightly outperform PLTIGs on language modeling, they lack high level structures needed for parsing.",
        "Therefore, PLTIGs have combined the best of two worlds: the language modeling capability of N-grams and the parse quality of context-free grammars.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: first, we present an overview of the PLTIG formalism; then we describe the experimental setup; next, we interpret and discuss the results of the experiments; finally, we outline future directions of the research."

        "The inspiration for the PLTIG formalism stems from the desire to lexicalize a context-free gram",
        "mar.",
        "There are three ways in which one might do so.",
        "First, one can modify the tree structures so that all context-free productions contain lexical items.",
        "Greibach normal form provides a well-known example of such a lexicalized context-free formalism.",
        "This method is not practical because altering the structures of the grammar damages the linguistic information stored in the original grammar (Schabes and Waters, 1994).",
        "Second, one might propagate lexical information upward through the productions.",
        "Examples of formalisms using this approach include the work of Magerman (1995), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), and Goodman (1997).",
        "A more linguistically motivated approach is to expand the domain of productions downward to incorporate more tree structures.",
        "The Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) formalism (Schabes et al., 1988), (Schabes, 1990) , although not context-free, is the most well-known instance in this category.",
        "PLTIGs belong to this third category and generate only context-free languages.",
        "LTAGs (and LTIGs) are tree-rewriting systems, consisting of a set of elementary trees combined by tree operations.",
        "We distinguish two types of trees in the set of elementary trees: the initial trees and the auxiliary trees.",
        "Unlike full parse trees but reminiscent of the productions of a context-free grammar, both types of trees may have nonterminal leaf nodes.",
        "Auxiliary trees have, in addition, a distinguished nonterminal leaf node, labeled with the same nonterminal as the root node of the tree, called the foot node.",
        "Two types of operations are used to construct derived trees, or parse trees: substitution and adjunction.",
        "An initial tree can be substituted into the nonterminal leaf node of another tree in a way similar to the substitution of nonterminals in the production rules of CFGs.",
        "An auxiliary tree is inserted into another tree through the adjunction operation, which splices the auxiliary tree into the target tree at a node labeled with the same nonterminal as the root and foot of the auxiliary tree.",
        "By using a tree representation, LTAGs extend the domain of locality of a grammatical primitive, so that they capture both lexical features and hierarchical structure.",
        "Moreover, the adjunction operation elegantly models intuitive linguistic concepts such as long distance dependencies between words.",
        "Unlike the N-gram model, which only offers dependencies between neighboring words, these trees can model the interaction of structurally related words that occur far apart.",
        "Like LTAGs, LTIGs are tree-rewriting systems, but they differ from LTAGs in their generative power.",
        "LTAGs can generate some strictly context-sensitive languages.",
        "They do so by using wrapping auxiliary trees, which allow nonempty frontier nodes (i.e., leaf nodes whose labels are not the empty terminal symbol) on both sides of the foot node.",
        "A wrapping auxiliary tree makes the formalism context-sensitive because it coordinates the string to the left of its foot with the string to the right of its foot while allowing a third string to be inserted into the foot.",
        "Just as the ability to recursively center-embed moves the required parsing time from 0(n) for regular grammars to 0(n3) for context-free grammars, so the ability to wrap auxiliary trees moves the required parsing time further, to 0(n6) for tree-adjoining grammars 1.",
        "This level of complexity is far too computationally expensive for current technologies.",
        "The complexity of LTAGs can be moderated by eliminating just the wrapping auxiliary trees.",
        "LTIGs prevent wrapping by restricting auxiliary tree structures to be in one of two forms: the left auxiliary tree, whose non-empty frontier nodes are all to the left of the foot node; or the right auxiliary tree, whose non-empty frontier nodes are all to the right of the foot node.",
        "Auxiliary trees of different types cannot adjoin into each other if the adjunction would result in a wrapping auxiliary tree.",
        "The resulting system is strongly equivalent to CFGs, yet is fully lexicalized and still 0(n3) parsable, as shown by Schabes and Waters (1994).",
        "Furthermore, LTIGs can be parameterized to form probabilistic models (Schabes and Waters, 1993).",
        "Informally speaking, a parameter is associated with each possible adjunction or substitution operation between a tree and a node.",
        "For instance, suppose there are V left auxiliary trees that might adjoin into node 77.",
        "Then there are V + 1 parameters associated with node 77 'The best theoretical upper bound on time complexity for the recognition of Tree Adjoining Languages is 0(M(n2)), where M (k) is the time needed to multiply two k x k boolean matrices.",
        "(Rajaselcaran and Yooseph, 1995)",
        "that describe the distribution of the likelihood of any left auxiliary tree adjoining into node 77.",
        "(We need one extra parameter for the case of no left adjunction.)",
        "A similar set of parameters is constructed for the right adjunction and substitution distributions."

        "For the sake of uniformity, we shall disallow adjunction into the root nodes of the auxiliary trees from now on.",
        "Figure 3 shows an LTIG that allows at most one left and one right adjunction for each elementary tree.",
