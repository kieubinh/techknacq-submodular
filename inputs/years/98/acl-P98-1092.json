        "Here, term extraction and the identification of syntactic variation relations are considered for topic detection.",
        "Variations are changes affecting the structure and the form of a term producing another textual unit close to the initial one e.g. dna amplification and amplification fingerprinting of dna.",
        "Variations can point to terminological evolution and thus to that of the underlying concept.",
        "Topic is used in its grammatical sense, i.e. the head word in a noun phrase.",
        "In the above term, fingerprinting is the topic (head word) and dna amplification its properties (modifiers).",
        "However, a topic cannot appear by chance in specialised litterature, so this grammatical definition needs to be backed up by empirical evidence such as recurrence of terms sharing the same head word.",
        "We constituted a test corpus of scientific abstracts and titles in English from the field of plant biotechnology making up ,-:-_-.29000 words.",
        "These texts covered publications made over 13 years (1981-1993).",
        "We focused on three syntactic variation types occurring frequently amongst terms : permutation, substitution and expansion (§2).",

        "They accounted for a wide spectrum of variation producing phenomena like the morpho-syntactic variation involving derivation in tree cutting and trees have been cut down'.",
        "We focused for the moment on terms appearing as noun phrases (NP).",
        "Although term variants can appear as verb phrases (VP), we believe that NP variants reflect more terminological stability thus a real shift in topic (root hair – 4 root hair deformation) than their VP counterpart (root hair – > the root hair appears deformed).",
        "Also, our application - research topic identification - being quite sensitive, requires a careful selection of term variants types depending on their interpretability."

        "Term extraction is based on their morpho-syntactic features.",
        "The morphological composition of NP terms allows for a limited number of categories mostly nouns, adjectives and some prepositions.",
        "Terms can appear under two syntactic structures : compound (the specific alfalfa nodulation) or syntagmatic (the specific nodulation of alfalfa).",
        "Since terms are used for naming concepts and objects in a given knowledge field, they tend to be relatively short textual units usually between 2-4 words though terms of longer length occur (endogeneous duck hepatitis B virus).",
        "In this study, we fixed a word limit of 7 not considering determiners and prepositions.",
        "Based on these three features, morphological make-up, syntactic structure and length, clauses are processed in order to extract complex terms rather than atomic ones.",
        "The motivation behind this approach is that complex terms reveal the association of concepts, hence they are more relevant for the application we are considering.",
        "A fine-grained term extraction strategy would isolate the concepts and thus lose the information given by their associations in the corpus.",
        "For this reason, we could not consider the use of an existing term extraction tool and thus had to carry out a manual simulation of the term extraction phase.",
        "NP splitting rules take into account the lexical nature of the constituent words and their raising properties (i.e. derived nouns as opposed to non-derived ones).",
        "Furthermore, following the empirical approach successfully implemented by Bourigault (1994), we split complex NPs only after a search has been performed in the corpus for occurrences of their sub-segments in unambiguous situations, i.e. when the sub-segments are not included in a larger segment.",
        "This favours the extraction of preconceived textual units possibly corresponding to domain terms.",
        "However morpho-syntactic features alone cannot verify the terminological status of the units extracted since they can also select non terms (see Smadja 1993).",
        "For instance root nodulation is a term in the plant biotechnology field whereas book review also found in the corpus is not.",
        "Thus in the first stage, the terms extracted are only plausible candidates which need to be filtered in order to eliminate the most unlikely ones.",
        "This filtering takes advantage of lexical information accessible at our level of analysis to fine-tune the statistical occurrence criterion which used alone, inevitably leads to a massive elimination."

        "Normally, exploiting syntactic information on the raising properties of the head noun (control) and following the distributional approach, the above segment will be split thus :",

        "Their existence confirms the relevance of our splitting rule which would have yielded the same result : oxygen control; nitrogen fixation gene expression; bradyrhizobium japonicum Altogether, 4463 candidate terms were extracted from our corpus and subjected to a filtering process which combined lexical and statistical criteria.",
        "The lexical criterion consisted in eliminating terms that contained a determiner other than the that remained after the splitting phase.",

        "The statistical criterion consisted in eliminating terms starting with the and appearing only once.",
        "These two criteria enabled us to eliminate 30% (1304) candidates and to retain 70% (3159) which we consider to be likely terminological units.",
        "We are aware that this filtering procedure remains approximate and cannot eliminate bad candidates like book review whose morphological and lexical make-up correspond to those of terms.",
