        "Conventional retrieval services do not provide users with a good access platform to help them achieve their practical purposes (Sakamoto, 1997; Lesk et al., 1997).",

        "5W1H information provides users with easy-to-understand classification axes and retrieval keys because it has a set of fundamental elements needed to describe events.",
