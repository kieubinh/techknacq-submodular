        "For the purpose of controlled indexing, we exploit the output of a NLP-based indexer and the structural relations between terms and variants in order to (1) enhance the coverage of the indexes, (2) incrementally build an a posteriori conceptual analysis of the document, and, (3) interweave controlled indexing, free indexing, and thesaurus acquisition.",
