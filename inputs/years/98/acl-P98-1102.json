        "Multimodal interfaces enable more natural and efficient interaction between humans and machines by providing multiple channels through which input or output may pass.",
        "Our concern here is with multimodal input, such as interfaces which support simultaneous input from speech and pen.",
        "Such interfaces have clear task performance and user preference advantages over speech only interfaces, in particular for spatial tasks such as those involving maps (Ovi-att 1996).",
        "Our focus here is on the integration of input from multiple modes and the role this plays in the segmentation and parsing of natural human input.",
        "In the examples given here, the modes are speech and pen, but the architecture described is more general in that it can support more than two input modes and modes of other types such as 3D gestural input.",
        "Our multimodal interface technology is implemented in QuickSet (Cohen et al. 1997), a working system which supports dynamic interaction with maps and other complex visual displays.",
        "The initial applications of QuickSet are: setting up and interacting with distributed simulations (Courtemanche and Cercanowicz 1995), logistics planning, and navigation in virtual worlds.",
        "The system is distributed; consisting of a series of agents (Figure 1) which communicate through a shared blackboard (Cohen et al. 1994).",
        "It runs on both desktop and handheld PCs, communicating over wired and wireless LANs.",
        "They can draw directly on the map and simultaneously issue spoken commands.",
        "Different kinds of entities, lines, and areas may be created by drawing the appropriate spatial features and speaking their type; for example, drawing an area and saying 'flood zone'.",
        "Orders may also be specified; for example, by drawing a line and saying 'helicopter follow this route'.",
        "The speech signal is routed to an HMM-Lil",
        "based continuous speaker-independent recognizer.",
        "The electronic 'ink' is routed to a neural net-based gesture recognizer (Pittman 1991).",
        "Both generate N-best lists of potential recognition results with associated probabilities.",
        "These results are assigned semantic interpretations by natural language processing and gesture interpretation agents respectively.",
        "A multimodal integrator agent fields input from the natural language and gesture interpretation agents and selects the appropriate multimodal or unimodal commands to execute.",
        "These are passed on to a bridge agent which provides an API to the underlying applications the system is used to control.",
        "In the approach to multimodal integration proposed by Johnston et al. 1997, integration of spoken and gestural input is driven by a unification operation over typed feature structures (Carpenter 1992) representing the semantic contributions of the different modes.",
        "This approach overcomes the limitations of previous approaches in that it allows for a full range of gestural input beyond simple deictic pointing gestures.",
        "Unlike speech-driven systems (Bolt 1980, Neal and Shapiro 1991, Koons et al. 1993, Wauchope 1994), it is fully multimodal in that all elements of the content of a command can be in either mode.",
        "Furthermore, compared to related frame-merging strategies (Vo and Wood 1996), it provides a well understood, generally applicable common meaning representation for the different modes and a formally well defined mechanism for multimodal integration.",
        "However, while this approach provides an efficient solution for a broad class of multimodal systems, there are significant limitations on the ex-pressivity and generality of the approach.",
        "A wide range of potential multimodal utterances fall outside the expressive potential of the previous architecture.",
        "Empirical studies of multimodal interaction (Oviatt 1996), utilizing wizard-of-oz techniques, have shown that when users are free to interact with any combination of speech and pen, a single spoken utterance maybe associated with more than one gesture.",
        "For example, a number of deictic pointing gestures may be associated with a single spoken utterance: 'calculate distance from here to here', 'put that there', 'move this team to here and prepare to rescue residents from this building'.",
        "Speech may also be combined with a series of gestures of different types: the user circles a vehicle on the map, says 'follow this route', and draws an arrow indicating the route to be followed.",
        "In addition to more complex multipart multimodal utterances, unimodal gestural utterances may contain several component gestures which compose to yield a command.",
        "For example, to create an entity with a specific orientation, a user might draw the entity and then draw an arrow leading out from it (Figure 3 (a)).",
        "To specify a movement, the user might draw an arrow indicating the extent of the move and indicate departure and arrival times by writing expressions at the base and head (Figure 3 (b)).",
        "These",
        "are specific examples of the more general problem of visual parsing, which has been a focus of attention in research on visual programming and pen-based interfaces for the creation of complex graphical objects such as mathematical equations and flowcharts (Lakin 1986, Wittenburg et all991, Helm et al. 1991, Crimi et al. 1995).",
        "The approach of Johnston et al. 1997 also faces fundamental architectural problems.",
        "The multimodal integration strategy is hard-coded into the integration agent and there is no isolatable statement of the rules and constraints independent of the code itself.",
        "As the range of multimodal utterances supported is extended, it becomes essential that there be a declarative statement of the grammar of multimodal utterances, separate from the algorithms and mechanisms of parsing.",
        "This will enable system developers to describe integration strategies in a high level representation, facilitating rapid prototyping and iterative development of multimodal systems."

        "The integrator in Johnston et al. 1997 does in essence parse input, but the resulting structures can only be unary or binary trees one level deep; unimodal spoken or gestural commands and multimodal combinations consisting of a single spoken element and a single gesture.",
        "In order to account for a broader range of multimodal expressions, a more general parsing mechanism is needed.",
        "Chart parsing methods have proven effective for parsing strings and are commonplace in natural language processing (Kay 1980).",
        "Chart parsing involves population of a triangular matrix of well-formed constituents: chart(i, j), where i and j are numbered vertices delimiting the start and end of the string.",
        "In its most basic formulation, chart parsing can be defined as follows, where * is an operator which combines two constituents in accordance with the rules of the grammar.",
        "Crucially, this requires the combining constituents to be discrete and linearly ordered.",
        "However, multimodal input does not meet these requirements:",
        "gestural input spans two (or three) spatial dimensions, there is an additional non-spatial acoustic dimension of speech, and both gesture and speech are distributed across the temporal dimension.",
        "Unlike words in a string, speech and gesture may overlap temporally, and there is no single dimension on which the input is linear and discrete.",
        "So then, how can we parse in this multidimensional space of speech and gesture?",
        "What is the rule for chart parsing in multidimensional space?",
        "Our formulation of multidimensional parsing for multimodal systems (multichart) is as follows.",
        "In place of numerical spans within a single dimension (e.g. chart(3,5)), edges in the multidimensional chart are identified by sets (e.g. multichartifis, 4, 2], [g, 6, 1]})) containing the identifiers(IDs) of the terminal input elements they contain.",
        "When two edges combine, the ID of the resulting edge is the union of their IDs.",
        "One constraint that linearity enforced, which we can still maintain, is that a given piece of input can only be used once within a single parse.",
        "This is captured by a requirement of non-intersection between the ID sets associated with edges being combined.",
        "This requirement is especially important since a single piece of spoken or gestural input may have multiple interpretations available in the chart.",
        "To prevent multiple interpretations of a single signal being used, they are assigned IDs which are identical with respect to the the non-intersection constraint.",
        "The multichart statement enumerates all the possible combinations that need to be considered given a set of inputs whose IDs are contained in a set X.",
        "The multidimensional parsing algorithm (Figure 4) runs bottom-up from the input elements, building progressively larger constituents in accordance with the ruleset.",
        "An agenda is used to store edges to be processed.",
        "As a simplifying assumption, rules are assumed to be binary.",
        "It is straightforward to extend the approach to allow for non-binary rules using techniques from active chart parsing (Earley 1970), but this step is of limited value given the availability of multimodal subcategorization (Section 4).",
        "while AGENDA # [ ] do remove front edge from AGENDA and make it CURRENTEDGE for each EDGE, EDGE E CHART",
        "For use in a multimodal interface, the multidimensional parsing algorithm needs to be embedded into the integration agent in such a way that input can be processed incrementally.",
        "Each new input received is handled as follows.",
        "First, to avoid unnecessary computation, stale edges are removed from the chart.",
        "A timeout feature indicates the shelf-life of an edge within the chart.",
        "Second, the interpretations of the new input are treated as terminal edges, placed on the agenda, and combined with edges in the chart in accordance with the algorithm above.",
        "Third, complete edges are identified and executed.",
        "Unlike the typical case in string parsing, the goal is not to find a single parse covering the whole chart; the chart may contain several complete non-overlapping edges which can be executed.",
        "These are assigned to a category command as described in the next section.",
        "The complete edges are ranked with respect to probability.",
        "These probabilities are a function of the recognition probabilities of the elements which make up the command.",
        "The combination of probabilities is specified using declarative constraints, as described in the next section.",
        "The most probable complete edge is executed first, and all edges it intersects with are removed from the chart.",
        "The next most probable complete edge remaining is then executed and the procedure continues until there are no complete edges left in the chart.",
        "This means that selection of higher probability complete edges eliminates overlapping complete edges of lower probability from the list of edges to be executed.",
        "Lastly, the new chart is stored.",
        "In ongoing work, we are exploring the introduction of other factors to the selection process.",
        "For example, sets of disjoint complete edges which parse all of the terminal edges in the chart should likely be preferred over those that do not.",
        "Under certain circumstances, an edge can be used more than once.",
        "This capability supports multiple creation of entities.",
        "For example, the user can utter 'multiple helicopters' point point point point in order to create a series of vehicles.",
        "This significantly speeds up the creation process and limits reliance on speech recognition.",
        "Multiple commands are persistent edges; they are not removed from the chart after they have participated in the formation of an executable command.",
        "They are assigned timeouts and are removed when their alloted time runs out.",
        "These 'self-destruct' timers are zeroed each time another entity is created, allowing creations to chain together."

        "Spoken phrases and pen gestures, which are the terminal elements of the multimodal parsing process, are referred to as lexical edges.",
        "They are assigned grammatical representations in the form of typed feature structures by the natural language and gesture interpretation agents respectively.",
        "For example, the spoken phrase 'helicopter' is assigned the representation in Figure 5.",
        "The cat feature indicates the basic category of the element, while content specifies the semantic content.",
        "In this case, it is a create_unit command in which the object to be created is a vehicle of type helicopter, and the location is required to be a point.",
        "The remaining features specify auxiliary information such as the modality, temporal interval, and probability associated with the edge.",
        "A point gesture has the representation in Figure 6.",
        "Multimodal grammar rules are productions of the form LHS 4 DTR1DTR2 where LHS,DTR1, and DT R2 are feature structures of the form indicated above.",

        "The constraints feature indicates an ordered series of constraints which must be satisfied in order for the rule to apply.",
        "Structure-sharing in the rule representation is used to impose constraints on the input feature structures, to construct the LH S category, and to instantiate the variables in the constraints.",
        "For example, in Figure 7, the basic constraint that the location of a located command such as 'helicopter' needs to unify with the content of the gesture it combines with is captured by the structure-sharing tag [5].",
        "This also instantiates the location of the resulting edge, whose content is inherited through tag [1].",
        "The application of a rule involves unifying the two candidate edges for combination against dtrl and dtr2.",
        "Rules are indexed by their cat feature in order to avoid unnecessary unification.",
        "If the edges unify with dtrl and dtr2, then the constraints are checked.",
        "If they are satisfied then a new edge is created whose category is the value of lhs and whose ID set consists of the union of the ID sets assigned to the two input edges.",
        "Constraints require certain temporal and spatial relationships to hold between edges.",
        "Complex constraints can be formed using the basic logical operators V , A, and The temporal constraint in Figure 7, overlap([7],[10]) V follow([7], [10], 4), states that the time of the speech [7] must either overlap with or start within four seconds of the time of the gesture [10].",
        "This temporal constraint is based on empirical investigation of multimodal interaction (Oviatt et al. 1997).",
        "Spatial constraints are used for combinations of gestural inputs.",
        "For example, close_to(X, Y) requires two gestures to be a limited distance apart (See Figure 12 below) and contact(X,Y) determines whether the regions occupied by two objects are in contact.",
        "The remaining constraints in Figure 7 do not constrain the inputs per se, rather they are used to calculate the time, prob, and modality features for the resulting edge.",
        "For example, the constraint combine_prob ([8] , [11], [4]) is used to combine the probabilities of two inputs and assign a joint probability to the resulting edge.",
        "In this case, the input probabilities are multiplied.",

        "For example, spoken inputs such as 'calculate distance from here to here' and 'sandbag wall from here to here' (Figure 8) result in edges which subcategorize for two gestures.",
