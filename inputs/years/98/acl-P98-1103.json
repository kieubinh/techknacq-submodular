        "In this paper we discuss the use of discourse context in spoken dialogue systems and argue that the knowledge of the domain, modelled with the help of dialogue topics is important in maintaining robustness of the system and improving recognition accuracy of spoken utterances.",
        "We propose a topic model which consists of a domain model, structured into a topic tree, and the Predict-Support algorithm which assigns topics to utterances on the basis of the topic transitions described in the topic tree and the words recognized in the input utterance.",
        "The algorithm uses a probabilistic topic type tree and mutual information between the words and different topic types, and gives recognition accuracy of 78.68% and precision of 74.64%.",
        "This makes our topic model highly comparable to discourse models which are based on recognizing dialogue acts."

        "One of the fragile points in integrated spoken language systems is the erroneous analyses of the initial speech input.'",
        "The output of a speech recognizer has direct influence on the performance of other modules of the system (dealing with dialogue management, translation, database search, response planning, etc.",
        "), and the initial inaccuracy usually gets accumulated in the later stages of processing.",
        "Performance of speech recognizers can be improved by tuning their language model and lexicon, but problems still remain with the erroneous ranking of the best paths: information content of the selected utterances may be wrong.",
        "It is thus essential to use contextual information to compensate various errors in the output, to provide expectations of what will be said next and to help to determine the appropriate dialogue state.",
        "However, negative effects of an inaccurate context have also been noted: cumulative error in discourse context drags performance of the system below the rates it would achieve were contextual information 1 Alexandersson (1996) remarks that with a 3000 word lexicon, a 75 % word accuracy means that in practice the word lattice does not contain the actually spoken sentence.",
        "not used (Qu et al., 1996; Church and Gale, 1991).",
        "Successful use of context thus presupposes appropriate context management: (1) features that define the context are relevant for the processing task, and (2) construction of the context is accurate.",
        "In this paper we argue in favour of using one type of contextual information, topic information, to maintain robustness of a spoken language system.",
        "Our model deals with the information content of utterances, and defines the context in terms of topic types, related to the current domain knowledge and represented in the form of a topic tree.",
        "To update the context with topics we introduce the Predict-Support algorithm which selects utterance topics on the basis of topic transitions described in the topic tree and words recognized in the current utterance.",
        "At present, the algorithm is designed as a filter which reorders the candidates produced by the speech recognizer, but future work encompasses integration of the algorithm into a language model and actual speech recognition process.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews the related previous research and sets out our starting point.",
        "Section 3 presents the topic model and the Predict-Support algorithm, and section 4 gives results of the experiments conducted with the model.",
        "Finally, section 5 summarises the properties of the topic model, and points to future research."

        "Previous research on using contextual information in spoken language systems has mainly dealt with speech acts (Nagata and Morimoto, 1994; Reithinger and Maier, 1995; M011er, 1996).",
        "In dialogue systems, speech acts seem to provide a reasonable first approximation of the utterance meaning: they abstract over possible linguistic realisations and, dealing with the illocutionary force of utterances, can also be regarded as a domain-independent aspect of communication.2 20f course, most dialogue systems include domain dependent acts to cope with the particular requirements of the domain, cf.Alexandersson (1996).",
        "Speech acts are also related to the task: information providing, appointment negotiat",
        "However, speech acts concern a rather abstract level of utterance modelling: they represent the speakers' intentions, but ignore the semantic content of the utterance.",
        "Consequently, context models which use only speech act information tend to be less specific and hence less accurate.",
        "Nagata and Morimoto (1994) report prediction accuracy of 61.7 %, 77.5 % and 85.1 % for the first, second and third best dialogue act (in their terminology: Illocution-ary Force Type) prediction, respectively, while Reithinger and Maier (1995) report the corresponding accuracy rates as 40.28 %, 59.62 % and 71.93 %, respectively.",
        "The latter used structurally varied dialogues in their tests and noted that deviations from the defined dialogue structures made the recognition accuracy drop drastically.",
        "To overcome prediction inaccuracies, speech act based context models are accompanied with the information about the task or the actual words used.",
        "Reithinger and Maier (1995) describe plan-based repairs, while /Willer (1996) argues in favour of domain knowledge.",
        "Qu et al.",
        "(1996) show that to minimize cumulative contextual errors, the best method, with 71.3% accuracy, is the Jumping Context approach which relies on syntactic and semantic information of the input utterance rather than strict prediction of dialogue act sequences.",
        "Recently also keyword-based topic identification has been applied to dialogue move (dialogue act) recognition (Garner, 1997).",
        "Our goal is to build a context model for a spoken dialogue system, and we emphasise especially the system's robustness, i.e. its capability to produce reliable and meaningful responses in presence of various errors, disfluencies, unexpected input and out-of-domain utterances, etc.",
        "(which are especially notorious when dealing with spontaneous speech).",
        "The model is used to improve word recognition accuracy, and it should also provide a useful basis for other system modules.",
        "However, we do not aim at robustness on a merely mechanical level of matching correct words, but rather, on the level of maintaining the information content of the utterances.",
        "Despite the vagueness of such a term, we believe that speech act based context models are less robust due to the fact that the information content of the utterances is ignored.",
        "Consistency of the information exchanged in (task-oriented) conversations is one of the main sources for dialogue coherence, and so pertinent in the context management besides speech acts.",
        "Deviations from a predefined dialogue structure, multifunctionality of utterances, various side-sequences, disfluencies, etc.",
        "cannot be dealt with on a purely abstract level of illocution, but require knowledge of the domain, expressed in the semantic content of the utterances.",
        "ion, argumentation etc.",
        "have different communicative purposes which are reflected in the set of necessary speech acts.",
        "Moreover, in multilingual applications, like speech-to-speech translation systems, the semantic content of utterances plays an important role and an integrated system must also produce a semantic analysis of the input utterance.",
        "Although the goal may be a shallow understanding only, it is not enough that the system knows that the speaker uttered a \"request\": the type of the request is also crucial.",
        "We thus reckon that appropriate context management should provide descriptions of what is said, and that the recognition of the utterance topic is an important task of spoken dialogue systems."

        "The topic (focus) is a means to describe thematically coherent discourse structure, and its use has been mainly supported by arguments regarding anaphora resolution and processing effort (search space limits).",
        "Our goal is to use topic information in predicting likely content of the next utterance, and thus we are more interested in the topic types that describe the information conveyed by utterances than the actual topic entity.",
        "Consequently, instead of tracing salient entities in the dialogue and providing heuristics for different shifts of attention, we seek a formalisation of the information structure of utterances in terms of the new information that is exchanged in the course of the dialogue.",
        "The purpose of our topic model is to assist speech processing, and so extensive and elaborated reasoning about plans and world knowledge is not available.",
        "Instead a model that relies on observed facts (= word tokens) and uses statistical information is preferred.",
        "We also expect the topic model to be general and extendable, so that if it is to be applied to a different domain, or more factors in the recognition of the information structure of the utterances3 are to be taken into account, the model could easily adapt to these changes.",

Instead of having only one utterance analysed at the time and predicting its topic, a speech recognizer produces a word lattice, and the topic is to be selected among candidates for several word strings.",

        "Since the out-of-domain words do not contribute to any expected topic type, the topic shift is not detected.",
        "On the other hand, if unknown but in-domain words are repeated, mutual information by which the topic types are supported is too coarse and fails to make necessary distinctions; hence, incorrect topics can be assigned.",

        "At the end we have to make a remark concerning the relevance of speech acts: our argumentation is not meant to underestimate their use for other purposes in dialogue modelling, but rather, to emphasise the role of topic information in successful context management: in our opinion the topics provide a more reliable and straighforward approximation of the utterance meaning than speech acts, and should not be ignored in the definition of context models for spoken dialogue systems."

        "We will also investigate further the relation between topics and speech acts, and specify their respective roles in context management for spoken dialogue systems.",
