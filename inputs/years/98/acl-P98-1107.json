        "The proposed method comprises two successive correcting processes.",
        "The first process uses pairs of strings: the first string is an erroneous substring of the utterance predicted by speech recognition, the second string is the corresponding section of the actual utterance.",
        "Errors are detected and corrected according to the database learned from erroneous-correct utterance pairs.",
        "The remaining errors are passed to the posterior process which uses a string in the corpus that is similar to the string including recognition errors.",

        "In spite of the increased performance of speech recognition systems, the output still contains many errors.",
        "For language processing such as a machine translation, it is extremely difficult to deal with such errors.",
        "In integrating recognition and translation into a speech translation system, the development of the following processes is therefore important: (1) detection of errors in speech recognition results; (2) sorting of speech recognition results by means of error detection; (3) providing feedback to the recognition process and/or making the user speak again; (4) correct errors, etc.",
        "For this purpose, a number of methods have been proposed.",
        "One method is to translate correct parts extracted from speech recognition results by using the semantic distance between words calculated with an example-based approach (Walcita et al., 97).",
        "Another method also obtains reliably recognized partial segments of an utterance by cooperatively using both grammatical and n-gram based statistical language constraints, and uses a robust parsing technique to apply the grammatical constraints described by context-free grammar (Tsukada et al., 97).",
        "However, these methods do not carry out any error correction on a recognition result, but only specify correct parts in it.",
        "In this paper we therefore propose a method for correcting errors, which is characterized by learning the trend of errors and expressions, and by processing in an arbitrary length string.",
        "Similar work on English was presented by (E.K.",
        "Ringger et al., 96).",
        "Using a noisy-channel model, they implemented a post-processor to correct word-level errors committed by a speech recognizer."

        "As described above, our proposed method has the following features: (1) Since the proposed method is designed with a arbitrary length string as a unit, it is capable of correcting errors which are hard to deal with by methods designed to treat words as units.",
        "For example, the insertion error (\"wo\") in the string (\"shiharai wo houhou\") shown in table 2 1 cannot be corrected by a method designed to treat words as units, because of the existence of the particle ' (\"wo\") as a correct word.",
        "However with the proposed method, it is possible to correct this kind of error by using the row of characters before and after ' (\"wo\").",
        "(2) In the proposed method of leaming the trend of errors and expressions with long strings, it is possible to correct errors where it is difficult to narrow the candidates down to the correct character with the probability of the character sequence alone.",
        "When considering the candidate for 'T' (\"te\") in 'LC T 6 I (\"shitetekitnasurbode\") shown in table 2-1 to satisfy the probability of the character sequence, its candidates, 'V (\"i\"), (\"o\"), 'TA' (\"itatla\") are arranged in order of increasing probability.",
        "It is therefore difficult to narrow the candidates into the correct character 'TA' (\"itazin\") by the probability of character sequence alone.",
        "But with the proposed method it is possible to correct this kind of error by using the row of the characters before and after '\"C' (\"te\").",
        "(3) Both the Error-Pattern-Database and String-Database can be mechanically prepared, which reduces the effort required to prepare the databases and makes it possible to apply this method to a new recognition system in a short time.",
        "From the evaluation, it became clear that the proposed method has the following effects:",
        "(1) It reduces over 8% of the errors.",
        "(2) It improves the understanding of the recognition results by 7%.",
        "(3) It has very little influence on correct recognition results.",
        "(4) It is more applicable for a recognition result with a few errors than one with many errors.",
        "Judging from these results and features, the use of the proposed method as a post-processor for speech recognition is likely to make a significant contribution to the performance of speech translation systems.",
        "In the future, we will try to improve the correcting accuracy by changing algorithms and will also try to improve translation performance by combining our method with Walcita's method."
