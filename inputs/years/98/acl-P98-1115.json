        "Treebanks, such as the Penn Treebank (PTB), offer a simple approach to obtaining a broad coverage grammar: one can simply read the grammar off the parse trees in the treebank.",
        "While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a square-root rate of growth of the rule set with corpus size suggests that the derived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would be required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit.",
        "However, we offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of structures within the treebank.",
        "This hypothesis is explored by applying an algorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules â€“ rules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules.",
        "The size of the resulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full treebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit.",
        "However, such a compacted grammar does not yield very good performance figures.",
        "A version of the compaction algorithm taking rule probabilities into account is proposed, which is argued to be more linguistically motivated.",
        "Combined with simple thresholding, this method can be used to give a 58% reduction in grammar size without significant change in parsing performance, and can produce a 69% reduction with some gain in recall, but a loss in precision."

        "The Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994) has been used for a rather simple approach to deriving large grammars automatically: one where the grammar rules are simply 'read off' the parse trees in the corpus, with each local subtree providing the left and right hand sides of a rule.",
        "Charniak (Charniak, 1996) reports precision and recall figures of around 80% for a parser employing such a grammar.",
        "In this paper we show that the huge size of such a treebank grammar (see below) can be reduced in size without appreciable loss in performance, and, in fact, an improvement in recall can be achieved.",
        "Our approach can be generalised in terms of Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) methods (see (Bonnema et al., 1997)) with the tree depth of 1.",
        "However, the number of trees produced with a general DOP method is so large that Bonnema (Bonnema et al., 1997) has to resort to restricting the tree depth, using a very domain-specific corpus such as ATIS or OVIS, and parsing very short sentences of average length 4.74 words.",
        "Our compaction algorithm can be easily extended for the use within the DOP framework but, because of the huge size of the derived grammar (see below), we chose to use the simplest PCFG framework for our experiments.",
        "We are concerned with the nature of the rule set extracted, and how it can be improved, with regard both to linguistic criteria and processing efficiency.",
        "In what follows, we report the worrying observation that the growth of the rule set continues at a square root rate throughout processing of the entire treebank (suggesting, perhaps that the rule set is far from complete).",
        "Our results are similar to those reported in (Krotov et al., 1994).",
        "1 We discuss an alternative possible source of this rule growth phenomenon, partial bracketting, and suggest that it can be alleviated by compaction, where rules that are redundant (in a sense to be defined) are eliminated from the grammar.",
        "Our experiments on compacting a PTB tree",
        "bank grammar resulted in two major findings: one, that the grammar can be compacted to about 7% of its original size, and the rule number growth of the compacted grammar stops at some point.",
        "The other is that a 58% reduction can be achieved with no loss in parsing performance, whereas a 69% reduction yields a gain in recall, but a loss in precision.",
        "This, we believe, gives further support to the utility of treebank grammars and to the compaction method.",
        "For example, compaction methods can be applied within the DOP framework to reduce the number of trees.",
        "Also, by partially lexicalising the rule extraction process (i.e., by using some more frequent words as well as the part-of-speech tags), we may be able to achieve parsing performance similar to the best results in the field obtained in (Collins, 1996).",
        "2 Growth of the Rule Set One could investigate whether there is a finite grammar that should account for any text within a class of related texts (i.e. a domain oriented sub-grammar of English).",
        "If there is, the number of extracted rules will approach a limit as more sentences are processed, i.e. as the rule number approaches the size of such an underlying and finite grammar.",
        "We had hoped that some approach to a limit would be seen using PTB II (Marcus et al., 1994), which larger and more consistent for bracketting than PTB I.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, however, the rule number growth continues unabated even after more than 1 million part-of-speech tokens have been processed."

        "Why should the set of rules continue to grow in this way?",
        "Putting aside the possibility that natural languages do not have finite rule sets, we can think of two possible answers.",
        "First, it may be that the full \"underlying grammar\" is much larger than the rule set that has so far been produced, requiring a much larger treebanked corpus than is now available for its extraction.",
        "If this were true, then the outlook would be bleak for achieving near-complete grammars from treebanks, given the resource demands of producing hand-parsed text.",
        "However, the radical incompleteness of grammar that this alternative implies seems incompatible with the promising parsing results that Charniak reports (Charniak, 1996).",
        "A second answer is suggested by the presence in the extracted grammar of rules such as (1).2 This rule is suspicious from a linguistic point of view, and we would expect that the text from which it has been extracted should more properly have been analysed using rules (2,3), i.e. as a coordination of two simpler NPs.",
        "Our suspicion is that this example reflects a widespread phenomenon of partial bracketting within the PTB.",
        "Such partial bracketting will arise during the hand-parsing of texts, with (human) parsers adding brackets where they are confident that some string forms a given constituent, but leaving out many brackets where they are less confident of the constituent structure of the text.",
        "This will mean that many rules extracted from the corpus will be 'flatter' than they should be, corresponding properly to what should be the result of using several grammar rules, showing only the top node and leaf nodes of some unspecified tree structure (where the 'leaf nodes' here are category symbols, which may be nonterminal).",

        "For example, the rule (1) can be parsed using the rules (2,3), as the structure (4) demonstrates.",
        "Note that, although a partial-structure rule should be parsable using other rules, it does not follow that every rule which is so parsable is a partial-structure rule that should be eliminated.",

        "The rules that remain when all rules have been checked constitute the compacted grammar.",
        "An interesting question is whether the result of compaction is independent of the order in which the rules are addressed.",

        "The grammar that we have extracted from PTB II, and which is used in the compaction experiments reported in the next section, is one that excludes such rules.",

        "We proved that the result of compaction is independent of the order in which the rules in the grammar are parsed in those cases involving 'mutual parsability' (discussed in Section 4), but Shirai's algorithm will eliminate both rules so that coverage is lost.",
