        "Language generation is an important subtask of applications like machine translation, human-computer dialogue, explanation, and summarization.",
        "The recurring need for generation suggests the usefulness of a general-purpose, domain-independent natural language generator (NLG).",
        "However, \"plugin\" generators available today, such as FUF/SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1998), MUMBLE (Meteer et al., 1987), KPML (Bateman, 1996), and CoGen-Tex's RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), require inputs with a daunting amount of linguistic detail.",
        "As a result, many client applications resort instead to simpler template-based methods.",
        "An important advantage of templates is that they sidestep linguistic decision-making, and avoid the need for large complex knowledge resources and processing.",
        "For example, the following structure could be a typical result from a database query on the type of food a venue serves:"

      "text": [
        "By using a template like <obj-name> 's <attribute> is <attrib-value>.",
        "the structure could produce the sentence, \"Top of the Mark's food type is American.\" Templates avoid the need for detailed linguistic information about lexical items, part-of-speech tags, number, gender, definiteness, tense, sentence organization, sub-categorization structure, semantic relations, etc., that more general NLG methods need to have specified in the input (or supply defaults for).",
        "Such information is usually not readily inferrable from an application's database, nor is it always readily available from other sources, with the breadth of coverage or level of detail that is needed.",
        "Thus, using a general-purpose generator can be formidable (Re-iter, 1995).",
        "However, templates only work in very controlled or limited situations.",
        "They cannot provide the expressiveness, flexibility or scalability that many real domains need.",
        "A desirable solution is a generator that abstracts away from templates enough to provide the needed flexibility and scalability, and yet still requires only minimal semantic input (and maintains reasonable efficiency).",
        "This generator would take on the responsibility of finding an appropriate linguistic realization for an underspecified semantic input.",
        "This solution is especially important in the context of machine translation, where the surface syntactic organization of the source text is usually different from that of the target language, and the deep semantics are often difficult to obtain or represent completely as well.",
        "In Japanese to English translation, for example, it is often hard to determine from a Japanese text the number or gender of a noun phrase, the English equivalent of a verb tense, or the deep semantic meaning of sentential arguments.",
        "There are many other obvious syntactic divergences as well.",
        "Thus, shifting such linguistic decisions to the generator is significantly helpful for client applications.",
        "However, at the same time, it imposes enormous needs for knowledge on the generator program.",
        "Traditional large-scale NLG already requires immense amounts of knowledge, as does any large-scale Al enterprise.",
        "NLG operating on a scale of 200,000 entities (concepts, relations, and words) requires large and sophisticated lexicons, grammars, ontologies, collocation lists, and morphological tables.",
        "Acquiring and applying accurate, detailed knowledge of this breadth poses difficult problems.",

        "cal Knowledge in a Natural Language Generator (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995).",
        "overcoming this knowledge acquisition bottleneck in NLG by tapping the vast knowledge inherent in English text corpora.",
        "Experiments showed that corpus-based knowledge greatly reduced the need for deep, hand-crafted knowledge.",
        "This knowledge, in the form of n-gram (word-pair) frequencies, could be applied to a set of semantically related sentences to help sort good ones from bad ones.",
        "A corpus-based statistical ranker takes a set of sentences packed efficiently into a word lattice, (a state transition diagram with links labeled by English words), and extracts the best path from the lattice as output, preferring fluent sentences over contorted ones.",
        "A generator can take advantage of this by producing a lattice that encodes various alternative possibilities when the information needed to make a linguistic decision is not available.",
        "Such a system organization shown in Figure 1, is robust against underspecified and even ambiguous input meaning structures.",
        "Traditionally, underspecification is handled with rigid defaults (e.g., assume present tense, use the alphabetically-first synonyms, use nominal arguments, etc.).",
        "However, the word lattice structure permits all the different possibilities to be encoded as different phrasings, and the corpus-based statistical extractor can select a good sentence from these possibilities.",
        "The questions that still remain are: What kind of input representation is minimally necessary?",
        "What kinds of linguistic decisions can the statistics reliably make, and which instead need to be made symbolically?",
        "How should symbolic knowledge be applied to the input to efficiently produce word lattices from the input?",
        "This paper describes Nitrogen, a generation system that computes word lattices from a meaning representation to take advantage of corpus-based statistical knowledge.",

        "Currently the quality of the output is limited by the use of only word bigram statistical information, which cannot handle long-distance agreement, or distinguish likely collocations from unlikely grammatical structure.",
        "However, we plan to remedy these problems by using statistical information extracted from the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1994) to rank tagged lattices and parse forests.",
        "Nitrogen's rule matching is much less expensive than graph unification, and lattices generated for sub-AMRs are cached and reused in subsequent references.",
        "The semantic roles used in the grammar formalism cover most common syntactic phenomena, though our grammar does not yet generate questions, or infer pronouns from explicit coreference.",
        "Nitrogen has been used extensively as part of a semantics-based Japanese-English MT system (Knight et al., 1995).",
        "Japanese analysis provides AMR's, which Nitrogen transforms into word lattices on the order of hundreds of nodes and thousands of arcs.",
        "These lattices compactly encode a number of syntactic variants that usually reach into the trillions and beyond.",
        "Most of these are somewhat ungrammatical or awkward, yet the statistical extractor rather successfully narrows them down to the top N best paths.",
