        "In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in parallel text alignment techniques.",
        "These techniques attempt to map various textual units to their translation and have proven useful for a wide range of applications and tools.",
        "A simple example of such a tool is probably the TransSearch bilingual concordancing system (Isabelle et al., 1993), which allows a user to query a large archive of existing translations in order to find ready-made solutions to specific translation problems.",
        "Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994).",
        "More sophisticated applications based on alignment technology have also been the object of recent work, such as the automatic building of bilingual lexical resources (Melamed, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995), the automatic verification of translations (Macklovitch, 1995), the automatic dictation of translations (Brousseau et al., 1995) and even interactive machine translation (Foster et al., 1997).",
        "Enthusiasm for this relatively new field was sparked early on by the apparent demonstration that very simple techniques could yield almost perfect results.",
        "For instance, to produce sentence alignments, Brown et al.",
        "(1991) and Gale and Church (1991) both proposed methods that completely ignored the lexical content of the texts and both reported accuracy levels exceeding 98%.",
        "Unfortunately performance tends to deteriorate significantly when aligners are applied to corpora which are widely different from the training corpus, and/or where the alignments are not straightforward.",
        "For instance graphics, tables, \"floating\" notes and missing segments, which are very common in real texts, all result in a dramatic loss of efficiency.",
        "The truth is that, while text alignment is mostly an easy problem, especially when considered at the sentence level, there are situations where even humans have a hard time making the right decision.",
        "In fact, it could be argued that, ultimately, text alignment is no easier than the more general problem of natural language understanding.",
        "In addition, most research efforts were directed towards the easiest problem, that of sentence-to-sentence alignment (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991; Debili, 1992; Kay and ROscheisen, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Simard and Plamondon, 1996).",
        "Alignment at the word and term level, which is extremely useful for applications such as lexical resource extraction, is still a largely unexplored research area(Melamed, 1997).",
        "In order to live up to the expectations of the",
        "various application fields, alignment technology will therefore have to improve substantially.",
        "As was the case with several other language processing techniques (such as information retrieval, document understanding or speech recognition), it is likely that a systematic evaluation will enable such improvements.",
        "However, before the ARCADE project started, no formal evaluation exercise was underway; and worse still, there was no multilingual aligned reference corpus to serve as a \"gold standard\" (as the Brown corpus did, for example, for part of speech tagging), nor any established methodology for the evaluation of alignment systems."

        "The underlying principle is the automatic detection of isolated cognates (i.e. for which no other similar word exists in a window of given size).",

        "A dynamic programming scheme is applied to all alignment levels in successive steps.",
        "IRMC This system involves a preliminary, rough word alignment step which uses a transfer dictionary and a measure of the proximity of words (Debili et al., 1994).",
        "Sentence alignment is then achieved by an algorithm which optimizes several criteria such as word-order conservation and synchronization between the two texts.",
        "LIA Like Jacal, the LIA system uses a preprocessing step involving cognate recognition which restricts the search space, but in a less restrictive way.",
        "Sentence alignment is then achieved through dynamic programming, using a score function which combines sentence length, cognates, transfer dictionary and frequency of translation schemes (1-1, 1-2, etc.).",

        "Nevertheless, the LIA system still achieves a satisfactory performance (90% char-recall and 94% char-precision), which can be explained by the efficiency of its word-based pre-alignment step, as well as the scoring function used to rank the candidate bisegments.",
