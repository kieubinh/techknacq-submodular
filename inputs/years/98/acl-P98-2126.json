        "The Natural Language Understanding Engine Test Environment (ETE) is a GUI software tool that aids in the development and maintenance of large, modular, natural language understanding (NLU) systems.",
        "Natural language understanding systems are composed of modules (such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers and semantic analyzers) which are difficult to test individually because of the complexity of their output data structures.",
        "Not only are the output data structures of the internal modules complex, but also many thousands of test items (messages or sentences) are required to provide a reasonable sample of the linguistic structures of a single human language, even if the language is restricted to a particular domain.",

        "Because of the complexity of the internal data structures and the number of test cases involved in testing a natural language understanding system, evaluation of testing results by manual comparison of the internal data structures is very difficult.",
        "The difficulty of examining NLU systems in turn greatly increases the difficulty of developing and extending the coverage of these systems, both because as the system increases in coverage and complexity, extensions become progressively harder to assess and because loss of coverage of previously working test data becomes harder to detect.",
        "The ETE addresses these problems by:",
        "1. managing batch input of large numbers of test sentences or messages, whether spoken or written.",
        "2. storing the NLU system output for a batch run.",
        "into a database.",
        "3. automatically comparing multiple levels of internal NLU data structures across batch runs of the same data with different engine versions.",
        "These data structures include part-of-speech tags, syntactic analyses, and semantic analyses.",
        "4. flagging and displaying changed portions of these data structures for an analyst's attention.",
        "5. providing access to a variety of database query options to allow an analyst to select inputs of potential interest, for example, those which took an abnormally long time to process, or those which contain certain words.",
        "6. providing a means for the analyst to annotate and record the quality of the various intermediate data structures.",
        "7. providing a basis for quantifying both regression and improvement in the NLU system."

        "Application level tests, in which the ability of the system to output the correct answer on a set of",
        "inputs is measured, have been used in natural language processing for a number of years (ATIS-3 (1991), MUC-6 (1995), Harman and Voorhees (1996)).",
        "Although these tests were originally designed for comparing different systems, they can also be used to compare the performance of sequential versions of the same system.",
        "These kinds of black-box tests, while useful, do not provide insight into the correctness of the internal NLU data structures since they are only concerned with the end result, or answer provided by the system.",
        "They also require the implementation of a particular application against which to test.",
        "This can be time-consuming and also can give rise to the concern that the NLU processing will become slanted toward the particular test application as the developers attempt to improve the system's performance on that application.",
        "The Parseval effort (Black (1991)) attempted to compare parsing performance across systems using the Treebank as a basis for comparison.",
        "Although Parseval was very useful for comparing parses, it did not enable developers to compare other data structures, such as semantic representations.",
        "In addition, in order to accommodate many different parsing formalisms for evaluation, it does not attempt to compare every aspect of the parses.",
        "Finally, Treebank data is not always available for domains which need to be tested.",

        "Neal et al.",
        "(1992) report on an effort to develop a more general evaluation tool for NLU systems.",
        "These approaches either focus on application level tests or presuppose the availability of large annotated test collections, which in fact are very expensive to create and maintain.",
        "For the purpose of diagnostic evaluation of different versions of the same system, an annotated test corpus is not absolutely necessary because defects and regressions of the system can be discovered from its internal data structures and the differences between them."

        "The intermediate data can be further compared systematically to reveal the behavior changes of a system.",
        "In a synchronic comparison, different tests are conducted for a version of the system by changing its parameters, such as the presence or absence of the lexical server, to determine the impact of the module to the system.",
        "In a diachronic comparison, tests are conducted for different versions of the system with the same parameters, to gauge the improvements of development effort.",
        "In practice, any two tests can be compared to determine the effect of certain factors on the performance of a NLU system.",
        "Conceptually, this type of matrix analysis can be",
        "represented in a coordinate system (Figure 1) in which a test is represented as a point and a comparison between two tests as an arrowhead line connecting the points.",
        "In theory, n-way and second order comparisons are possible, but in practice 2-way first order comparisons are most useful.",
        "ETE is designed for the Unisys natural language engine (NLE), a NL system implemented in Quintus Prolog.",

        "(1998)).",
        "The interface also enforces the constraints on each test.",
        "For example, two tests with different corpora cannot be compared.",
        "• Compare various types of analysis data.",
        "ETE employs different algorithms to compute the difference between different types of data and display the disparate regions graphically The comparison routines are implemented in Prolog except for trees.",
        "Lists comparisons are trivial in Prolog.",
        "Graph comparison is achieved in two steps.",
        "First, all linkage arguments in graph terms are substituted by variables such that links are maintained by unification.",
        "Second, set operations are applied to compute the differences.",
        "Let U(G) denote the variable substitution of a graph G and diff(Gx, Gy) the set of different terms between Gx and Gy, then diff(Gx, Gy) = Gx - U(Gy) and diff(Gy, Gx) = Gy - U(Gx), where (-) is the Prolog set difference operation.",
        "Under this definition, differences in node ordering and link labeling of two graphs are discounted in comparison.",
        "For instance, Gx = [f(a, el), g(el, e2)1, for which U(Gx) = [f(a, X), g(X, Y)], is deemed identical to Gy = [g(e3, e4), f(a, e3)], where ei are linkage arguments.",

        "respectively.",
        "Trees are treated as text files and the DOS command fc (file comparison) is utilized to compare the differences.",
        "Since fc has several limits, we are considering replacing it with a tree matching algorithm that is more accurate and sensitive to linguistic structures.",
        "• Present a hierarchical view of batch",
        "analyses.",
        "We base our approach to visual information management upon the notion of \"overview, filter, detail-on-demand.\"",
        "For each test, ETE displays a diagnostic report and a table of sentence analyses.",
        "The diagnostic report is an overview to direct an analyst's attention to the problem areas which come either from the system's own diagnostics, or from comparisons.",
        "ETE is therefore still useful even without every sentence being annotated.",
        "The sentence analyses table presents the intermediate data in their logical order and shows on demand the details of each type of data.",

        "A unique feature of ETE is in-report query, which enables query options on various reports to allow an analyst to quickly zoom in to interesting data based on the diagnostic information.",
        "Compared with Tgrep (1992) which works only on Treebank trees, ETE provides a more general and powerful search mechanism for a complex database.",
        "• Provide graphical and contextual",

        "Annotation is a problem because it still takes a human.",
