        "Our results elaborate the conditions under which TOOT' s response strategies lead to greater performance, and allow us to make predictions.",
        "For example, our performance equation predicts that improving mean recognition and/or judiciously restricting the use of barge-in will enhance performance.",
        "Our current research is aimed at automatically adapting dialogue behavior in TOOT, to increase mean recognition and thus overall agent performance (Walker et al., 1998).",
        "Future work utilizing PARADISE will attempt to generalize our results, to make a more predictive model of agent performance.",
        "Performance function estimation needs to be done iteratively over different tasks and dialogue strategies.",
        "We plan to evaluate additional cooperative response strategies in TOOT (e.g., intensional summaries (Kalita et al., 1986), summarization and constraint elicitation in isolation), and to combine TOOT data with data from other agents (Walker et al., 1998)."
