        "1997), Galaxy (Goddeau et al.",
        "1994), TRAINS (Allen et al.",
        "1995), Verbmobil (Wahlster 1993), Waxholm (Carlson 1996), and others.",
        "Our architecture is distinguished from these in its treatment of discourse-level processing.",
        "Most architectures, including ours, contain modules for speech recognition and natural language interpretation (such as morphology, syntax, and sentential semantics).",
        "Many include a module for interfacing with the back-end application.",
        "If the dialogue is two-way, the architectures also include modules for natural language generation and speech synthesis.",
        "Architectures differ in how they handle discourse.",
        "Some have a single, separate module labeled \"discourse processor\", \"dialogue com-ponent\", or perhaps \"contextual interpretation\".",
        "Others, including earlier versions of our system, bury discourse functions inside other modules, such as natural language interpretation or the back-end interface.",
        "An innovation of this work is the compartmentalization of discourse processing into three generically definable components – Dialogue Management, Context Tracking, and Pragmatic Adaptation (described in Section 1 below) – and the software control structure for interaction between these and other components of a spoken dialogue system (Section 2).",
        "In Section 3, we examine the dialogue processing requirement in a complex scenario involving multiple users and multiple simultaneous dialogues of diverse types.",
        "We describe how our architecture supports implementations of such a scenario.",
        "Finally, we describe two implemented spoken dialogue systems that embody this architecture (Section 4)."

        "We have presented a modular, flexible architecture for spoken dialogue systems which separates discourse processing into three component tasks with three corresponding software modules: Dialogue Management, Context Tracking, and Pragmatic Adaptation.",
        "We discussed the roles of these components in a complex, near-future scenario portraying a variety of dialogue types.",
        "We closed by describing implementations of these dialogues using the architecture presented, including development and porting of the first two discourse components.",
        "The architecture itself is derived from a standard blackboard control structure.",
        "This is appropriate for our current dialogue processing research in two ways.",
        "First, it does not require a prior full enumeration of all possible subroutine firing sequences.",
        "Rather, the possibilities emerge from local decisions made by modules that communicate with the blackboard, depositing data and consuming data from the blackboard.",
        "Second, as we learn categories of dialogue segment types, we can move away from the fully decentralized control structure, to one in which the central Dialogue Manager, as a blackboard module with special status, assumes increasing decision power for processing flow, in cases of dialogue segment type with which it is familiar.",
        "The intended contribution of this work is thus in the generic definition of standard dialogue functions such as dynamic troubleshooting (repair), context updating, anaphora resolution, and translation of natural language interpretations into functional interface languages of back-end systems.",
        "Future work includes investigation of issues raised when a human is engaged in more than one of our scenario dialogues concurrently.",
        "For example, how does one speech enabled dialogue system among many determine when it is being addressed by the user, and how can the system judge whether the current utterance is human-computer, i.e., to be fully interpreted and acted upon by the system as opposed to a human-human utterance that is to be simply recorded, transcribed, or translated without interpretation."
