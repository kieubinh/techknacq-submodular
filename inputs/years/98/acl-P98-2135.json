        "Large video collections require content-based information browsing, retrieval, extraction, and summarization to ensure their value for tasks such as real-time profiling and retrospective search.",
        "Whereas image processing for video indexing currently provides low level indeces such as visual transitions and shot classification (Zhang et al.",
        "1994), some research has investigated the use of linguistic streams (e.g., closed captions, transcripts) to provide keyword-based indexes to video.",
        "Story-based segmentation remains illusive.",
        "For example, traditional text tiling approaches often undersegment broadcast news because of rapid topic shifts (Mani et al.",
        "1997).",
        "This paper takes a corpus-based approach to this problem, building linguistic models based on an analysis of a digital collection of broadcast news, exploiting the regularity utilized by humans in signaling topic shifts to detect story segments."

        "Human communication is characterized by distinct discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986) which is used for a variety of purposes including managing interaction between participants, mitigating limited attention, and signaling topic shifts.",
        "In processing genre such as technical or journalistic texts, programs can take advantage of explicit discourse cues (e.g., \"the first\", \"the most important\") to perform tasks such as summarization (Paice 1981).",
        "Our initial inability to segment topics in closed caption news text using thesaurus based subject assessments (Liddy and Myaeng 1992) motivated an investigation of explicit turn taking signals (e.g., anchor to reporter handoff).",
        "We analyzed programs (e.g., CNN PrimeNews) from an over one year corpus of closed caption texts with the intention of creating models of discourse and other cues for segmentation."

        "While human captioners employ standard cues to signal discourse shifts in the closed caption stream (e.g., \"»\" is used to signal a speaker shift whereas \">»\" signals a subject change), these can be erroneous, incomplete, or inconsistent.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a typical excerpt from our corpus.",
        "Our creation of a gold standard corpus of a variety of broadcast sources indicates that transcription word error rates range from 2% for prerecorded programs such as 60 Minutes news magazine to 20% for live transcriptions (including errors of insertion, deletion, and transposition).",

        "• broadcasts start and end with the anchor • reporter segments are preceded by an introductory anchor segment and together they form a single story • commercials serve as story boundaries",
        "Similar but unique structure is also prevalent in many other news programs such as CNN Prime News (See Figure 1) or MS-NBC.",
        "For example, the structure for the Jim Lehrer News Hour provides not only segmentation information but also content information for each segment.",
        "Thus, the order of stories is consistently:",

        "Story structure is also useful for multimedia summarization.",

        "Recall degrades when porting these same algorithms to different news programs (e.g., CNN, Jim Lehrer) given the genre differences as described in Section 2.1.",
        "Errors in story boundary detection include erroneously splitting a single story segment into two story segments, and merging two contiguous story segments into a single story segment.",
        "Furthermore, given our error-driven transformation based proper name taggers operate at approximately 80% precision and recall, this can adversely impact discourse cue detections.",
        "Also, our preliminary evaluation of speech transcription results in word error rates of approximately 50%, which suggest non captioned text is not yet feasible for this class of segmentation.",

      "heading": "6. Conclusion and Future Work",
      "text": [
        "We have described and evaluated a news story segmentation algorithm that detects news discourse structure using discourse cues that exploit fixed expressions and transformational-based, part of speech and named entity taggers created using error-driven learning.",
        "The implementation utilizes a time-enhanced finite state automata that represents discourse states and their expected temporal occurance in a news broadcast based on statistical analysis of the corpus.",
        "This provides an important mechanism to enable topic tracking, indeed we take the text from each segment an run this through a commercial topic identification routine an provide the user with a list of the top classes associated with each story (See Figure 3).",
        "The segmentor has been integrated into a system (BNN) for content-based news access and has been deployed in a corporate intranet and is currently being evaluated for deployment in the US government and a national broadcasting corporation.",
        "We have improved segmentation performance by exploiting cues in audio and visual streams (e.g., speaker shifts, scene changes) (Maybury et al.",
        "1997).",
        "To obtain a better indication of annotator reliability and for comparative evaluation, we need to measure interannotator agreement.",
        "Future research includes investigating the relationship of other linguistic properties, such as co-reference, intonation contours, and lexical semantics coherence to serve as a measure of cohesion that might further support story segmentation.",
        "Finally, we are currently evaluating in user studies which mix of media elements (e.g., key frame, named entities, key sentence) are most effective in presenting story segments for different information seeking tasks (e.g., story identification, comprehension, correlation)."
