        "Maximum entropy modelling has been recently introduced to the NLP community and proved to be an expressive and powerful framework.",
        "The maximum entropy model is a model which fits a set of predefined constraints and assumes maximum ignorance about everything which is not subject to its constraints thus assigning such cases with the most uniform distribution.",
        "The most uniform distribution will have the entropy on its maximum Because of its ability to handle overlapping features the maximum entropy framework provides a principle way to incorporate information from multiple knowledge sources.",
        "It is superior to traditionally used for this purpose linear interpolation and Katz back-off method.",
        "(Rosenfeld, 1996) evaluates in detail a maximum entropy language model which combines unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and long-distance trigger words, and provides a thorough analysis of all the merits of the approach.",
        "• Now at Harlequin Ltd.",
        "The iterative scaling algorithm (Darroch&Ratcliff, 1972) applied for the parameter estimation of maximum entropy models computes a set of feature weights (As) which ensure that the model fits the reference distribution and does not make spurious assumptions (as required by the maximum entropy principle) about events beyond the reference distribution.",
        "It, however, does not guarantee that the features employed by the model are good features and the model is useful.",
        "Thus the most important past of the model building is the feature selection procedure.",
        "The key idea of the feature selection is that if we notice an interaction between certain features we should build a more complex feature which will account for this interaction.",
        "The newly added feature should improve the model: its Kullback-Leibler divergence from the reference distribution should decrease and the conditional maximum entropy model will also have the greatest log-likelihood (L) value: The basic feature induction algorithm presented in (Della Pietra et al., 1995) starts with an empty feature space and iteratively tries all possible feature candidates.",
        "These candidates are either atomic features or complex features produced as a combination of an atomic feature with the features already selected to the model's feature space.",
        "For every feature from the candidate feature set the algorithm prescribes to compute the maximum entropy model using the iterative scaling algorithm described above, and select the feature which in the largest way minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence or maximizes the log-likelihood of the model.",
        "This approach, however, is not computationally feasible since the iterative scaling is computationally expensive and to compute models for many candidate features many times is unreal.",
        "To",
        "make feature ranking computationally tractable in (Della Pietra et al., 1995) and (Berger et al., 1996) a simplified process proposed: at the feature ranking stage when adding a new feature to the model, all previously computed parameters are kept fixed and, thus, we have to fit only one new constraint imposed by the candidate feature.",
        "Then after the best ranked feature has been established, it is added to the feature space and the weights for all the features are recomputed.",
        "This approach estimates good features relatively fast but it does not guarantee that at every single point we add the best feature because when we add a new feature to the model all its parameters can change.",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach to feature selection for the maximum entropy models.",

        "The sample space consists of observed events of interest mapped to a set of atomic features T which we should define beforehand.",
        "Thus every observation from the sample space is a binary vector of atomic features: if an observation includes a certain feature, its corresponding bit in the vector is turned on (set to 1) otherwise it is 0.",
        "When we have a set of atomic features T and a training sample of configurations w, we can build the feature collocation lattice.",
        "Such collocation lattice will represent, in fact, the factorial constraint space (x) for the maximum entropy model and at the same time will contain all seen and logically implied configurations (w+).",

        "To support generalizations over the domain we also want to add to the lattice the nodes which are shared parts with other nodes in the lattice.",
        "Thus we add to the lattice all sub-configurations of a newly added configuration which are the intersections with the other nodes.",
        "We increment the configuration frequency (ak ) of a node each time we see in the training samples this particular configuration in full.",

        "The necessity to add the collocations comes from the fact that the features (or nodes) can overlap with each other and we want to have a unique node for such overlap.",

        "When this way we add the features to the optimized lattice some candidate features might not sufficiently contribute to the probability distribution on the lattice.",
        "For instance, in the example presented on Figure 1, after we added the feature [B] (case b) the only remaining undecided node was [Cl.",
        "If the node [Cl is truly hidden (i.e. it does not have its own observation frequency) and all other nodes are optimally decided, there is no point to add the node [C] into the lattice and instead of having 9 nodes we will have only",
        "3.",
        "Another consideration which we apply during",
        "the lattice building is to penalize the development of low frequency (but not zero frequency) nodes i.e. the nodes with no reliable statistics on them.",
        "Thus we smooth the estimates on such nodes with the uniform distribution (which has the entropy on its maximum):",
        "So for high frequency nodes this smoothing is very minor but for nodes with frequencies less than two thresholds the penalty will be considerable.",
        "This will favor nodes which do not create sparce collocations with other nodes.",
        "The described method is similar in spirit to the method of word trigger incorporation to a trigram model suggested in (Rosenfeld, 1996): if a trigram predicts well enough there is no need for an additional trigger.",
        "The main difference is that we do not recompute the maximum entropy model every time but use our own frequency redistribution method over the collocation lattice.",
        "This is the crucial difference which makes a tremendous saving in time.",
        "We also do not require a newly added feature to be either atomic or a collocation of an atomic feature with a feature already included into the model as it was proposed in (Della Pietra et al., 1995) (Berger et al., 1996).",

        "We can set a certain threshold on the weights, so all the candidate nodes whose As differ from 1 less than this threshold will be unconstrained in one go.",
