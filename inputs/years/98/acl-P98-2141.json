        "Speech-to-speech translation necessitates quick and perspicuous responses to natural communication.",
        "Furthermore, since dialogues continuously expand, it is essential to incrementally translate inputs to avoid interrupting the coherency of communications.",
        "Therefore, a high degree of incrementality and acceptability in translation such as simultaneous interpretation is essential.",
        "To satisfy these requirements, an incremental translation system, which functions as a simultaneous interpreter, is seen as an efficient solution in this field.",
        "The main characteristic of incremental translations is the translation process.",
        "This is activated synchronously with the input, in contrast with conventional sentence-by-sentence-based translation which cannot start processing until the end of an input (Kitano, 1994).",
        "However, in incremental translation, we believe that the following issues must be resolved to achieve actual simultaneous interpretation :",
        "• How to define Information Units (IUs) (Halliday, 1994) to determine appropriate components for translation – Since differences exist among the word order of various languages, especially between linguistically distant languages such as English and Japanese, appropriate transfer units, equally effective for both the source and target languages, have to be defined.",
        "• How to determine plausible translation for each IU – In terms of the information content, the greater the number of words contained in IUs, the less semantic ambiguity in translation, or the later the response is obtained.",
        "Because of time restrictions, deterministic processing by exploiting specious measures (e.g. linguistical or statistical plausibility) is required for each IU translation in order to shorten the length of Ns.",
        "• How to install simultaneous interpreters' know-how (i.e. empirical knowledge) – In practical simultaneous interpretation, human",
        "translators generally use strong sentence planning using particular empirical know-how.",
        "The exploitation of this kind of knowledge is essential for achieving practical simultaneous interpretation (Kitano, 1994).",
        "Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT) (Furuse, 1994a) (Mima, 1997) has been proposed, and an efficient method of spoken dialog translation.",
        "TDMT has the following key features:",
        "• Utilization of Constituent Boundary Patterns (CB-Patterns) (Furuse, 1994b) (Furuse, 1996) – CB-Patterns based on meaningful information",
        "units are applied to parse an input incrementally and produce translations based on the synchronization of the source and target language structure pairs (Abeille, 1990) (Shieber, 1990).",
        "This contrasts with the linguistic manner of applying grammar rules.",
        "The result of this provides for incremental translations that can even handle lengthy input",
        "efficiently by splitting the input into appropriate and meaningful chunks.",
        "In addition, • Existence of efficient disambiguation scheme – by dealing with best-only substructures",
        "utilizing stored empirical translation examples compiled from a linguistic database, the explosion of structural ambiguities is significantly constrained (Furuse, 1996).",
        "Accordingly, TDMT has the advantage of having both the capability to define effective IU and an efficient deterministic processing scheme in incremental spoken-language translation.",
        "Additionally, in exploiting the empirical knowledge that is required in practical simultaneous interpretation, we can assume that the empirical knowledge is described within the linguistic resource of simultaneous interpretation corpora.",
        "(Harbusch, 1992) proposed a method of default handling in incremental generation based on this observation.",
        "In this paper, we describe the achievement of practical simultaneous interpretation using a TDMT.",
        "Furthermore, we discuss what kind of empirical knowledge is required for realizing efficient simultaneous interpretation, in terms of a simultaneous translator's knowledge, as well as proposing a method to exploit this empirical knowledge in an example-based framework in order to produce consistent translations.",
        "A preliminary experiment analyzing our proposed scheme indicates that it should be able to be used in achieving simultaneous interpretation systems.",
        "The next section of the paper briefly explains incremental translation using TDMT.",
        "Section 2 discusses the type of empirical knowledge necessary in simultaneous interpretation using some examples.",

        "The output sentence is generated as a translation result from the structure for the whole input, which is composed of best-first substructures.",
        "In order to limit the combinations of patterns and control the appropriate timing of each partial utterance during pattern application, we distinguish pattern levels, and specify the linguistic sublevel permitted for use in the assigned variables for each linguistic level.",
        "This is because if any combinations of patterns are permitted, it is obvious that the possibility of combinations are easily exploded.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of the relationship between linguistic levels.",
        "Every CB-pattern is categorised as one of the linguistic levels, and a variable on a given level is instantiated by a string on the linguistic levels in the second column of Table 1.",
