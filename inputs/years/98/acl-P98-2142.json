        "Weischedel and Sondheimer (1983) described two types of ill-formedness: relative (i.e. limitations of the computer system) and absolute (e.g. misspellings, mistyping, agreement violation etc).",
        "These two types of problem cause ill-formedness of a sentence at various levels, including typographical, orthographical, morphological, phonological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels.",
        "Typographical spelling errors have been studied by many people (Damerau, 1964; Peterson, 1980; Pollock and Zamora, 1983).",
        "Mitton (1987) found a large proportion of real-word errors were orthographical: to 4 too, were – > where.",
        "At the sentential level, types of syntactic errors such as co-occurrence violations, ellipsis, conjunction errors, and extraneous terms have been studied (Young, Eastman, and Oakman, 1991).",
        "In addition, Min (1996) found 0.6% of words misspelt (447/68966) in 300 email messages, leading to about 12.0% of the 3728 sentences having errors.",
        "Various systems have focused on the recovery of ill-formed text at the morpho-syntactic level (Vosse, 1992), the syntactic level (Irons, 1963; Lyon, 1974), and the semantic level (Fass and Wilks, 1983; Carbonell and Hayes, 1983).",
        "Those systems identified and repaired errors in various ways, including using grammar-specific rules (meta-rules) (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1983), least-cost error recovery based on chart parsing (Lyon, 1974; Anderson and Backhouse, 1981), semantic preferences (Fass and Wilks, 1983), and heuristic approaches based on a shift-reduce parser (Vosse, 1992).",
        "Systems that focus on a particular level miss errors that can only be detected using higher level knowledge.",
        "For example, at the lexical level, in I saw a man if the park, the misspelt word if is undetected.",
        "At the syntactic level, in I saw a man in the pork, the misspelling of pork can only be detected using semantic information.",
        "This paper describes the automatic correction of ill-formed sentences by using integrated information from three levels (lexical, syntactic, and semantic).",
        "The CHAPTER system (CHArt Parser for Two-stage Error Recovery), performs two-stage error recovery using generalised top-down chart parsing for the syntax phase (cf. Mellish, 1989; Kato, 1994).",
        "It uses an augmented context-free grammar, which covers verb subcategorisations, passives, yes/no and WH-questions, finite relative clauses, and EQUI/SOR phenomena.",
        "The semantic processing uses a conceptual hierarchy and act templates (Fass and Wilks, 1983), that express semantic restrictions.",
        "Surface case processing is used to help extract meaning (Grishman and Peng, 1988) by mapping surface cases to their corresponding conceptual cases.",
        "Unlike other systems that",
        "have focused on error recovery at a particular level (Damerau, 1964; Mellish, 1989; Fass and Wilks, 1983), CHAPTER uses an integrated agenda system, which integrates lexical, syntactic, surface case, and semantic processing.",

        "If no parse is found, the second stage tries to repair a single error: either at the lexical or syntactic level (§1.1) or at the semantic level (§1.2).",
        "The second parser uses generalised top-down strategies (Mellish, 1989) and a restricted bidirectional algorithm (Satta and Stock, 1994) for error detection and correction.",
        "Errors at the syntactic level are assumed to arise from replacement of a word by a known or unknown word, addition of a known or unknown word, or deletion of a word.",
        "Real-word replacement errors may occur because of simple misspellings, or agreement violations.",

        "CHAPTER's syntactic error recovery system employs generalised top-down and bidirectional bottom-up chart parsing (cf. Mellish, 1989) using an augmented context-free grammar.",
        "The system is composed of two phases: error detection and error correction (see section 4 in Min, 1996).",
        "A single syntactic error is detected by the following two processes: (1) top-down expectation: expands a goal using an augmented context-free grammar.",
        "(A goal is a partial tree, which may contain one or more syntactic categories, specifically a subtree of a syntax tree corresponding to a single context-free rule, and which might contain syntactic errors.",
        "For example, the first goal for the ill-formed sentence",
        "I have a bif book is <S needs from 0 to 5 with penalty score 4>.)",
        "(2) bottom-up satisfaction: searches for an error using a goal and inactive arcs made by the first-stage parser, and produces a need-chart network;",
        "The error detected by this process is corrected by the following two processes:",
        "(3) a constituent reconstruction engine: repairs the error and reconstructs local trees by retracing the need-chart network; and (4) spelling correction corrects spelling",
        "errors (see Min and Wilson, 1995).",
        "Because of space limitations, this paper focuses on (3) and (4).",
        "Consider the sentence I saw a man if the park.",
        "The top-down expectation phase would produce the initial goal for the sentence, <goal S is needed from 0 to 7>, and expand it using grammar rules, <(S NP VP) is needed from 0 to 7>.",
        "Next, a bottom-up satisfaction phase uses the inactive arcs left behind by the first-stage parser to refine and localise the error by looking for the leftmost or rightmost constituent of the expanded goal in a bidirectional mode.",
        "For example, given an inactive arc, <NP(\"I\") from 0 to 1>, the left-to-right process is applied: for the expanded goal S, NP (\"I\") is found from 0 to 1 and VP is needed from 1 to 7: or, more briefly, <S – > NP(\"I\") • VP is needed from 1 to 7>.",
        "This data structure is called a need-arc.",
        "A need-arc is similar to an active arc, and it includes the following information: which constituents are already found and which constituents are needed for the recovery of a local tree between two positions, together with the arc's penalty score.",
        "From this need-arc, another goal, <goal VP is needed from 1 to 7>, is produced.",
        "After detecting an error using the top-down expectation and bottom-up satisfaction phases, the detected error is corrected using two types of chart item: a goal and a need-arc, and the types of the goal's or need-arc's constituent and its penalty score.",
        "The penalty score (PS(G)) of a goal (or need-arc) G, whose syntactic category is L and whose two positions are FROM and TO, is computed as follows: PS(G) = RW(G) - MEL(L) where RW(G) is the number of remaining words to be processed, (ie.",
        "TO – FROM), and MEL(L) is the minimal extension length of the category L.",
        "MEL (Minimal Extension Length) is the minimum number of preterminals necessary to produce the rule's LHS category.",
        "For example, the MEL of S is 2, because of examples like \"I go\".",
        "Using the penalty scores, three error correction conditions are as follows:",
        "• The substitution correction condition is: the goal's label is a single lexical category, and its penalty score is 0 (there is a replaced word) • The addition correction condition is: the goal's label is a single lexical category, and its penalty score is 1 (there is an omitted word).",
        "• The deletion correction condition is:",
        "there is no constituent needed for repair, and the penalty score of the need-arc is 1 (there is an extra word).",
        "The repaired constituent produced with these conditions is used to repair constituents all the way up to the original S goal via the need-chart network.",
        "This process is performed by the constituent reconstruction engine.",
        "At the syntactic level, the choice of the best correction relies on two penalty schemes: error-type penalties and penalties based on the weight (or importance) of the repaired constituent in its local tree.",
        "The error-type penalties are 0.5 for substitution errors, and 1 for deletion or addition errorsl.",
        "The weight penalty of a repaired constituent in a local tree is either 0.1 for a head daughter, 0.5 for a non-head daughter, or 0.3 for a recursive head-daughter (e.g. NP in the right-hand side of the rule NP – > NP PP).",
        "The weight penalty is accumulated while retracing the need-chart network.",
        "In effect, the system seeks a best repair with minimal length path from node S to the error location in the syntax tree.",
        "Often more than one repair is suggested.",
