        "For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).",
        "However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense.",
        "While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g. neural networks, a situation semantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g. Connoly et al.",
        "1994; Mitkov 1995; Tin & Alc.man 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical NLP systems, and to enhance further the automatic processing of growing language resources.",
        "Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or linguistic knowledge (Baldwin 1997; Dagan & Itai 1990; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996; Mitkov 1998; Nasukawa 1994; Williams et al.",
        "1996).",
        "Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphora resolution.",
        "It is also an example of how anaphors in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.",
        "Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic)."

      "text": [
        "With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semantic and discourse analysis (which is vital for real-world applications), we developed a robust, knowledge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.",
        "It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as \"antecedent indicators\").",
        "The approach works as follows: it takes as an input the output of a text processed by a part-of-speech tagger, identifies the noun phrases which precede the anaphor within a distance of 2 sentences, checks them for gender and number agreement with the anaphor and then applies the genre-specific antecedent indicators to the remaining candidates (see next section).",
        "The noun phrase with the highest aggregate score is proposed as antecedent; in the rare event of a tie, priority is given to the candidate with the higher score for immediate reference.",
        "If immediate reference has not been identified, then priority is given to the candi",
        "date with the best collocation pattern score.",
        "If this does not help, the candidate with the higher score for indicating verbs is preferred.",

        "Antecedent indicators (preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.",
        "Candidates are assigned a score (-1, 0, 1 or 2) for each indicator; the candidate with the highest aggregate score is proposed as the antecedent.",
        "The antecedent indicators have been identified empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, \"nonprepositional\" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms.",
        "Whilst some of the indicators are more genre-specific (term preference) and others are less genre-specific (\"immediate reference\"), the majority appear to be genre-independent.",

        "Lexically reiterated items include repeated synonymous noun phrases which may often be preceded by definite articles or demonstratives.",
        "Also, a sequence of noun phrases with the same head counts as lexical reiteration (e.g. \"toner bottle\", \"bottle of toner\", \"the bottle\").",

        "\"Non-prepositional\" noun phrases A \"pure\", \"non-prepositional\" noun phrase is given a higher preference than a noun phrase which is part of a prepositional phrase (0, -1).",

        "Here \"the VCR\" is penalised (-1) for being part of the prepositional phrase \"into the VCR\".",
        "This preference can be explained in terms of salience from the point of view of the centering theory.",
        "The latter proposes the ranking \"subject, direct object, indirect object\" (Brennan et al.",
        "1987) and noun phrases which are parts of prepositional phrases are usually indirect objects.",

        "noun phrase (pronoun)\".",
        "Owing to lack of syntactic information, this preference is somewhat weaker than the collocation preference described in (Dagan & Itai 1990).",
        "Example: Press the keyi down and turn the volume up... Press iti again.",
        "Immediate reference In technical manuals the \"immediate reference\" clue can often be useful in identifying the antecedent.",
        "The heuristics used is that in constructions of the form \"...(You) V1 NP ... con (you) V2 it (con (you) V3 it)\", where con e {and/or/before/after...}, the noun phrase immediately after V1 is a very likely candidate for antecedent of the pronoun \"it\" immediately following V2 and is therefore given preference (scores 2 and 0).",
        "This preference can be viewed as a modification of the collocation preference.",

        "Referential distance In complex sentences, noun phrases in the previous clause2 are the best candidate for the antecedent of an anaphor in the subsequent clause, followed by noun phrases in the previous sentence, then by nouns situated 2 sentences further back and finally nouns 3 sentences further back (2, 1, 0, -1).",
        "For anaphors in simple sentences, noun phrases in the previous sentence are the best candidate for antecedent, followed by noun phrases situated 2 sentences further back and finally nouns 3 sentences further back (1, 0, -1).",
        "Term preference NPs representing terms in the field are more likely to be the antecedent than NPs which are not terms (score 1 if the NP is a term and 0 if not).",
        "As already mentioned, each of the antecedent indicators assigns a score with a value (-1, 0, 1, 2).",
        "These scores have been determined experimentally on an empirical basis and are constantly being updated.",
        "Top symptoms like \"lexical reiteration\" assign score \"2\" whereas \"non-prepositional\" noun phrases are given a negative score of \"-1\".",
        "We should point out that the antecedent indicators are preferences and not absolute factors.",
        "There might be cases where one or more of the antecedent indicators do not \"point\" to the correct antecedent.",
        "For instance, in the sentence \"Insert the cassette into the VCR i making sure iti is turned on\", the indicator \"non-prepositional noun phrases\" would penalise the correct antecedent.",
        "When all preferences (antecedent indicators) are taken into account, however, the right antecedent is still very likely to be tracked down - in the above example, the \"non-prepositional noun phrases\" heuristics (penalty) would be overturned by the \"collocational preference\" heuristics."
