        "A text consists of multiple sentences that have semantic relations with each other.",
        "They form semantic units which are usually called discourse segments.",
        "The global discourse structure of a text can be constructed by relating the discourse segments with each other.",
        "Therefore, identifying segment boundaries in a text is considered as a first step to construct the discourse structure(Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "The use of surface linguistic cues in a text for identification of segment boundaries has been extensively researched, since it is impractical to assume the use of world knowledge for discourse analysis of real texts.",
        "Among a variety of surface cues, lexical cohesion(Halliday and Hasan, 1976), the surface relationship among words that are semantically similar, has recently received much attention and has been widely used for text segmentation(Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Okumura and Honda, 1994).",
        "Okumura and Honda (Okumura and Honda, 1994) found that the information of lexical cohesion is not enough and incorporation of other surface information may improve the accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method for identifying segment boundaries of a Japanese text with the aid of multiple surface linguistic cues, such as conjunctives, ellipsis, types of sentences, and lexical cohesion.",
        "There are a variety of methods for combining multiple knowledge sources (linguistic cues)(McRoy, 1992).",
        "Among them, a weighted sum of the scores for all cues that reflects their contribution to identifying the correct segment boundaries is often used as the overall measure to rank the possible segment boundaries.",
        "In the past researches (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Cohen, 1987), the weights for each cue tend to be determined by intuition or trial and error.",
        "Since determining weights by hand is a labor-intensive task and the weights do not always to achieve optimal or even near-optimal performance(Rayner et al., 1994), we think it is better to determine the weights automatically in order to both avoid the need for expert hand tuning and achieve performance that is at least locally optimal.",
        "We begin by assuming the existence of training texts with the correct segment boundaries and use the method of multiple regression analysis for automatically training the weights.",
        "However, there is a well-known problem in the methods of automatically training the weights, that the weights tend to be overfitted to the training data.",
        "In such a case, the weights cause the degrade of the performance for other texts.",
        "It is considered that the overfitting problem is caused by the relatively large number of the parameters (linguistic cues) compared with the size of the training data.",
        "Furthermore, all of the linguistic cues are not always useful.",
        "Therefore, we optimize the use of cues for training the weights.",
        "We think if only the useful cues are selected from the entire set of cues, better weights can be obtained.",
        "Fortunately, since several methods for parameters selection are already developed in the multiple regression analysis, we use one of these methods called the stepwise method.",
        "Therefore we think we can obtain the weights only for the useful by the using the multiple regression analysis and the stepwise method.",
        "To give the evidence for the above claims that are summarized below, we carry out some preliminary experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach, even though our experiments might be small-scale.",

        "First we explain this method used for text segmentation with multiple linguistic cues.",

        "Each point, p(n,n+1), is a candidate for a segment boundary and has a score scr(n,n+ I) which is calculated by a weighted sum of the scores for each cue i, scri(n,n + 1), as follows:",

        "• Occurrence of topical markers (i = 1..4).",
        "If the topical marker `wa' or the subjective postpo-sition `ga' appears either just before or after p(n,n + I), add 1 to scr,(n,n +1).",

        "If one of the six types of conjunctives 1 appears in the head of the sentence n+1, add 1 to scri(n,n+1).",
        "• Occurrence of anaphoric expressions (i = 11..13).",
        "If one of the three types of anaphoric expressions2 appears in the head of the sentence n+ 1, add 1 to scri(n, n + 1).",

        "15..18).",
        "If both sentences n and n+1 are judged as one of the four types of sentences3, add 1 to scri(n,n +1).",
        "• Occurrence of lexical chains (i = 19..22).",
        "Here we call a sequence of words which have lexical cohesion relation with each other a lexical chain like(Morris and Hirst, 1991).",
        "Like Morris and Hirst, we assume that lexical chains tend to indicate portions of a text that form a semantic unit.",
        "We use the information of the lexical chains and the gaps of lexical chains that are the parts of the chains with no words.",
        "The gap of a lexical chain can be considered to indicate a small digression of the topic.",
        "In the case that a lexical chain or a gap ends at sentence n, or begins at sentence n + 1, add 1 to scri(n,n + 1).",
        "Here we assume that related words are the words in the same class on the-saurus'.",
        "• Change of the modifier of words in lexical chains (i = 23).",
        "If the modifier word of words in lexical chains changes in the sentence n + 1, add 1 to scri(n, n + 1).",
        "This cue originates in the idea that it might indicate the different aspect of the topic becomes the new topic.",
        "The above cues indicate both the plausibility and implausibility of the point as the segment boundary.",
        "Occurrence of the topical marker 'wa', for example, the indicates the segment boundary plausibility, while occurrence of anaphora, succession of the same type sentence indicate the implausibility.",
