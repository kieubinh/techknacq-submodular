        "The project that we have started is intended for the minority French speaking Acadian community living in Atlantic Canada.",
        "In many families, parents used to go to English schools and sometimes cannot adequately help their children in their school work.",
        "Children, who now go to French schools, often switch back to English for their leisure activities because of the scarcity of options open to them.",
        "Many of these children use English syntax as well as borrowed vocabulary quite frequently.",
        "In brief, this setting of language learning is not that of a typical native speaker.",
        "We begin our presentation with a literature review of related work in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) particularly on Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL and Intelligent CALL) followed by the principles that this community is now expecting from system builders.",
        "In the following sections we summarize an empirical study that helped us define the learner model.",
        "Then, in the last section we propose the system's general architecture and an overview some of its activities; particularly those that counteract Anglicisms by double generating examples in standard French and in the local dialect using linguistic resources usually used in machine translation.",
        "To our knowledge, there are no systems that use machine translation tools for generating two versions of the same language instead of multilingual generation.",
        "Another novelty is in the pedagogical approach of exposing the learner to the expert model and to the learner model in a comparative manner, thus helping to clarify the sources of error."

        "Among the first milestones in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) was Carbonell's system (1970) that used a knowledge-base to check the student's answers and to allow him/her to interact in \"natural language\".",
        "BUGGY, by Brown and Burton (1978) is another system more oriented towards student error diagnostic.",
        "At around the same period researchers were starting to put also some emphasis on the teaching strategies adopted in the system such as in WEST, Burton & Brown (1976).",
        "It's with such works and many others later, that Intelligent Tutoring Systems' architecture was more or less separated into four modules: an expert's model, a learner's model, a teacher's model, and an interface, Wengers (1987).",
        "However, language learning had its own specific difficulties that were not generalized in other ITS systems.",

        "These are some of the issues of high interest, Chanier, Renie & Fouquere (1993).",
        "Recent systems show how researchers are being more open to psycho linguistic, pedagogical and applied linguistic theories.",
        "For example, The ICICLE Project is based on L2 learning theory (McCoy et al., 1996); Alexia (Selva et al., 1997) and FLUENT (Hamburger and Hashim, 1992) are based on constructivism, Mr. Collins (Bull et al., 1995) is based on four empirical studies in an effort to \"discover\" student errors and their learning strategies.",
        "Another tendency, that is very noticeably parallel to that of NLP, is the development of sophisticated language resources such as dictionaries for language (lexical) learning as exemplified by CELINE at Grenoble (Menezo et al., 1996), the SAFRAN project (1997) and The Reader at Princeton University (1997) which uses WordNet , or real corpuses as in the European project Camille (Ingraham et al., 1994).",
