        "Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide computable account for some definite descriptions.",
        "To this end, we define in terms of inclusion the notion of distinguishing description and of distinguishable entities introduced by [Dale 89].",
        "These defmitions allow us to give conditions of wellformedness for incomplete distinguishing descriptions.",
        "We also extend the notion of distinguishing description to take into account cases of synonymy and hyponymy.",
        "We describe a real application of a guided composition system where this sort of expressions arise.",
        "1.Introduction Many studies in natural language processing are concerned with how to generate or understand defmite descriptions that evoke a discourse entity already introduced in the context.",
        "An interesting solution to this problem was proposed by [Dale 89] in terms of distinguishing descriptions and distinguishable entities.",
        "Informally, a distinguishing description is a definite description which designates one and only one entity among others in a context set.",
        "Many natural language interfaces need to deal with this sort of NPs.",
        "We develop an application where these NPs occur in a particular way: the application works in a guided composition mode where correct sentences have to be produced word by word by the system.",
        "So, the problem of the (contextual) correctness of an incomplete distinguishing description arises.",
        "Moreover, the system has to understand (complete or incomplete) distinguishing descriptions in wider cases of references than those intended by [Dale 89], including cases of hyponymy and so on.",
        "We are going to show that the way we refme the notions introduced by Dale allows us to treat these two points in a rather simple and efficient manner.",
        "In §2, we present our definitions of distinguishing descriptions and distinguishable entities and we use them to deal with incomplete distinguishing descriptions and wider cases of reference.",
        "An algorithm for incomplete distinguishing description production is given.",
        "§3 presents the application, §4 related works and §5 concludes.",
        "2.Dealing with distinguishing descriptions Following [Dale 96], let us consider that the context contains a set of entities ED, {q, e2, ...,en} and that each entity ei is described by the set of its properties Pei.",
        "[Dale 89] introduced the notion of distinguishing description (id) which is the linguistic realisation of a set of properties which are together true of an entity ei, but of no other entity in E. [Dale 89] also mentions the notion of distinguishable entity, which is intuitively an entity that can be distinguished from the others by the use of a distinguishing description made from its set of properties.",
        "Using inclusion between sets of properties, we can say that:",
        "Similarly to the process of generating a di from the set of properties of an entity to designate it, we will consider that to every definite description corresponds the set of properties (noted Pea) that it contains (informally the set of properties of which the definite description is the linguistic realisation).",
        "We will say that a definite description designates every entity ei of E such that Tag Pei (the entity agrees with the description).",
        "Then, according to the definition given in [Dale 891 and the uniqueness requirement, we can say that 2. a definite description is a distinguishing description if {eil Pac Pei) is a singleton.",
        "These two definitions will help us to deal with incomplete descriptions and to extend the notion of distinguishing description.",
        "2.1Treating distinguishing descriptions in a guided composition system Guided composition is a paradigm for NLP which is an answer to various limitations to NLP interfaces, especially limitations due to coverage of lexicons and grammars ([Rincel & al 89]).",
        "The basic idea is to inform the user, at every step, about the abilities of the system: for example, such a system can allow the user to ask what word(s) can appear at a time in a sentence.",
        "Then, the user chooses among the words proposed and so on.",
        "Therefore, the system must provide only expected words, i.e. words that can lead to a correct whole sentence.",
        "In particular, the system must generate partially (word by word) definite descriptions which have to be correct from a contextual point of view when they form complete NPs.",
        "In a guided composition point of view, the problem is then to fmd how to know as early as possible if a string of words (an incomplete distinguishing description or lifd) may or may not lead to a correct distinguishing description.",
        "In order to treat //4 we have to define conditions so as to decide when it will lead to a correct definite description.",
        "For example, if there are two kings on a chessboard, one black and one white, the defmite description 'le roi' ('the king') is a correct definite description from a syntactical point of view, but not from a contextual point of view because two entities of the context can be designated by it.",
        "However, it is a contextually correct incomplete definite description because it can lead to a correct distinguishing description if completed by 'noir' ('black') or 'blanc' ('white').",
        "Conversely, if there is no bishop on the chessboard, the definite description 'le fou' ('the bishop') is neither a distinguishing description nor a (contextually) correct incomplete ddbecause it doesn't designate any entity of the context and, moreover, can't be completed to designate one.",
        "So, an III is considered as correct if it can lead to a definite description which is a dd.",
        "As seen in this example, an III can designate more than one entity (as for the 14 we note Pia the set of properties from which an kidis made and the Idd designates every entity ei such that Piag Pe); so it is clear that the uniqueness requirement is not adequate to caracterise correct idd Let DE be the set of distinguishable entities of E. In order to be sure that an kid can always be completed to be a dd, a necessary and sufficient property is that some of the entities designated by the Idd are in DE, i.e",
        "3. an Idd is correct iff {ei I PIdIC Pei} n DE # 0.",
        "Actually, an id/which designates entities in DE can be continued into add by using properties which lead to designate one and only one of these entities.",
        "Finally, 4. an III can be add if there exists one and only one entity ei in E that agrees with it.",
        "Notice that the uniqueness requirement must be met on E and not DE.",
        "Actually, there may be only one entity in DE that agrees with an Wand several others in E that agree with",
        "it (see example below).",
        "In this case, the /// is correct but is not yet a dd.",
        "It is also interesting to note that the only entity that agrees with the dd is the referent of the defmite description.",
        "That is to say that the process of verifying if an Mefis correct leads to solve the definite description in the end.",
        "Let us have a look at an example: Suppose we have a set of entities",
        "of which are : ei is a dog, e2 is a dog that barks, e3 is a dog that barks, e4 is a red bird that sings, e5 is a red bird, e6is a bird that flies.",
        "In this example, e2 and e3 are not distinguishable, because their sets of properties are identical (and so Pe3 g Pe 2 and Pe2 g Pe3 ).",
        "ei is not distinguishable because Pei g T. Finally, e5 is not distinguishable because /les Pe41• Therefore, only e4 and e6 are distinguishable entities.",
        "So, the set DE is not empty and, in the guided composition mode, the III 'le' ('the') can be proposed.",
        "What words can be proposed after?",
        "According to this context, 'le chien' ('the dog') is not a correct id/because there is no distinguishable entity agreeing with it.",
        "On the contrary, 'l'oiseau' ('the bird') is correct and can lead to at least three different id 'l'oiseau qui chante' (the bird that sings') which designate e4 and is minimal, 'l'oiseau rouge qui chante' ('the red bird that sings') which designates e4 but is not minimal and 'l'oiseau qui vole' ('the bird that flies') which designates e6.",
        "Notice that, for instance, 'l'oiseau rouge' (The red bird') is not a 14 although there is exactly one distinguishable entity (e4) that agrees with it: this //designates also e5.",
        "The uniqueness requirement must be met on the whole set of entities from the context, and not only on the set of all distinguishable entities."

      "text": [
        "Using the definition of distinguishing description based on inclusion given above, we are going to show that this notion can be refmed to take into account more subtle cases of reference.",
        "We define a more discerning inclusion between surface descriptions and sets of properties in order to treat cases of synonymy, nominalisation, hyponymy and so on: we want to generalize the notion of agreement to every case where a description is able to \"evoke\" an entity.",
        "Actually, it is well known (see for example [Corblin 95]) that an entity can be designated not only in terms strictly equal to those which served to introduce it.",
        "For example, a dog can be designated by 'the animal' or a child who robs something by 'the robber'.",
        "To take these cases into account, we define the – inclusion (noted ) between sets of properties as follow: - some – inclusion are given (these are the basic one) like for instance (animal) E (dog) or (robber) a (child, rob) i.e representations of relations of hyponymy, synonymy, and so on.",
        "These inclusions have to be known by the system; - for all P, P', P\" sets of properties, if PE P g P\" then PE P\"; - for all P, P' sets of properties, if P P', then P-P' can be partionned into subsets which are – included in P'.",
        "Basic – inclusion representing relations of hyponymy is not too hard to define, and is useful for a lot of treatments in NLP (conceptual aspects of NLP, for example).",
        "Other basic – inclusions need more knowledge (about the world and the language), not so easy to implement, but also necessary in other parts of the treatment of natural language.",
        "The ~inclusion is transitive and works as expected on unions of sets.",
        "We use it (instead of simple inclusion) to compare a set of properties of an Mer(or a Id) and a set of properties of an entity and we say that the set of entities designated by a a (or a lid) is then {ei 1 Pieta Pei}.",
        "So, this inclusion allows to use the distinguishing description 'the robber' to designate an entity that is a child who robs something.",
        "So it's a nice extension of the inclusion, when used to define the sets of entity an Idd(or a Id) designates.",
        "It is also interesting to see if – inclusion can be used between sets of entities' properties to define the notion of distinguishable entity.",
        "Suppose we have two entities in the context, one which is a robber and the other which is a child who has robbed something.",
        "If we use – inclusion to find distinguishable entities, then the set of properties of the entity which is a robber is – included in the set of properties of the other, and so the entity which is a robber is not distinguishable.",
        "But we know that in an example like 'A robber meets a child who robs something.",
        "The robber ...', the defmite description 'the robber' rather designates the first entity introduced as 'a roober' than the second one.",
        "And this implies that the first entity is distinguishable.",
        "So, we must not use the – inclusion to distinguish entities (but only the simple inclusion).",
        "The remaining problem is then that, in this case, the defmite description 'the robber' is – included in two distinguishable entities ('a robber' and 'a child who robs something'), and then can't be a dd, in the sense introduced in § 2.1.",
        "To take into account an example like the one above and the effect of the – inclusion, we must refine the defmition of what can be a id a //must designate (in the sense of the – inclusion) only one entity of the context.",
        "But if there is more than one, but only one entity e such that Pac Pe (with the simple inclusion), then the ddis correct and the entity designated is e. As shown below, we have used this inclusion while dealing with incomplete distinguishing description."
