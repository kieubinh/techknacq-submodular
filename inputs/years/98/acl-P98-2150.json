        "Yoshida-Honmachi, Sakyo, Kyoto 606-01, Japan For languages that have articles, like English, we can use articles (\"the\", \"a\", and so on) to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not.",
        "In contrast, for languages that have no articles, like Japanese, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent.",
        "We previously estimated the referential properties of noun phrases that correspond to articles for the translation of Japanese noun phrases into English (Murata and Nagao 1993).",
        "By using these referential properties, our system determines the referents of noun phrases in Japanese sentences.",
        "Noun phrases are classified by referential property into generic noun phrases, definite noun phrases, and indefinite noun phrases.",

        "This is because even if the referential property of a noun phrase is a definite noun phrase, the noun phrase does not refer to the entity denoted by a noun phrase which has a different modifier or possessor.",
        "Therefore, we also use the modifiers and possessors of noun phrases in determining referents of noun phrases.",
        "In connection with our approach, we would like to emphasize the following points:",
        "• So far little work has been done on determining the referents of noun phrases in Japanese.",
        "• Since the Japanese language has no articles, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase has an antecedent or not.",

        "• We determine the possessors of entities denoted by noun phrases and use them like modifiers in estimating the referents of noun phrases.",
