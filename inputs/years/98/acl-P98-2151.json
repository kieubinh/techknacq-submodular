        "The WWW has opened up an era in which an unrestricted number of people publish their messages electronically through their online documents.",

        "1.",

        "Hypertext links cannot very much help readers recognize the content of a document.",
        "3.",
        "The WWW authors tend to be less careful about wording and readability than in traditional printed media.",
        "Currently there is no systematic means for quality control in the WWW.",
        "Although HTML is a flexible tool that allows you to freely write and read messages on the WWW, it is neither very convenient to readers nor suitable for automatic processing of contents.",
        "We have been developing an integrated platform for document authoring, publishing, and reuse by combining natural language and WWW technologies.",
        "As the first step of our project, we defined a new tag set and developed tools for editing tagged texts and browsing these texts.",
        "The browser has the functionality of summarization and content-based retrieval of tagged documents.",
        "This paper focuses on summarization based on this system.",
        "The main features of our summarization method are a domain/style-free algorithm and personalization to reflect readers' interests and preferences.",
        "This method naturally outperforms the traditional summarization methods, which just pick out sentences highly scored on the basis of superficial clues such as word count, and so on."

        "However, most previous works use several superficial clues and heuristics on specific styles or configurations of documents to summarize.",
        "For example, clues for determining the importance of a sentence include (1) sentence length, (2) keyword count, (3) tense, (4) sentence type (such as fact, conjecture and assertion), (5) rhetorical relation (such as reason and example), and (6) position of sentence in the whole text.",

        "Such a computation is rather robust.",
        "Present summarization systems (Watanabe, 1996: Hovy and Lin, 1997) use such clues to calculate an importance score for each sentence, choose sentences",
        "according to the score, and simply put the selected sentences together in order of their occurrences in the original document.",
        "In a sense, these systems are successful enough to be practical, and are based on reliable technologies.",
        "However, the quality of summarization cannot be improved beyond this basic level without any deep content-based processing.",
        "We propose a new summarization method based on GDA.",
        "This method employs a spreading activation technique (Hasida et al., 1987) to calculate the importance values of elements in the text.",
        "Since the method does not employ any heuristics dependent on the domain and style of documents, it is applicable to any GDA-tagged documents.",
        "The method also can trim sentences in the summary because importance scores are assigned to elements smaller than sentences.",
        "A GDA-tagged document naturally defines an intra-document network in which nodes correspond to elements and links represent the semantic relations mentioned in the previous section.",
        "This network consists of sentence trees (syntactic head-daughter hierarchies of subsentential elements such as words or phrases), coreference/anaphora links, document/subdivision/paragraph nodes, and rhetorical relation links.",
