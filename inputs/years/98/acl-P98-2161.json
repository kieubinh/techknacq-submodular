        "Knowledge acquisition is a serious bottleneck for natural language understanding systems.",
        "For this reason, large-scale linguistic resources have been compiled and made available by organizations such as the Linguistic Data Consortium (Comlex) and Princeton University (WordNet).",
        "Systems making use of these resources can greatly accelerate the development process by avoiding the need for the developer to recreate this information.",
        "In this paper we describe how we integrated these large scale linguistic resources into our natural language understanding system.",
        "Client-server architecture was used to make a large volume of lexical information and a large knowledge base available to the system at development and/or run time.",
        "We discuss issues of achieving compatibility between these disparate resources."

        "Natural language processing in the Unisys natural language understanding (NLU) system (Dahl, Norton and Scholz (1998), Dahl (1992)) is done by a natural language (NL) engine with the architecture shown in Figure 1.",
        "Processing stages include lexical lookup, syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, and pragmatic analysis.",
        "Each stage has been designed to use linguistic data such as the lexicon and grammar, which are maintained separately from the engine, and can easily be adapted to specific applications."

        "The template NL Engine, on which all NL Engine applications are based, contains lexical information for about 3000 English words.",
        "This includes information on an exhaustive set of closed-class words -- prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, etc.",
        "It also includes information for a few hundred of the most frequently-used words in each of the open-class word classes, the nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs.",
        "An NL Toolkit enables a developer to enter such information for additional words manually.",
        "Since the core vocabulary of 3000 words is insufficient for any real application, manual development could be a substantial task.",
        "Our linguistic servers are provided to greatly reduce the magnitude of that task.",
        "The servers contain the necessary information for many more words than the base system.",
        "This information can be extracted at development time, modified if appropriate (for instance, an application may not need all senses of a word), and included in the NL Engine application.",
        "â€¢ The linguistic servers may or may not be present at run time of a fully-developed application (at the deployer's choice).",
        "When information about a word is needed during processing, the available lexical resources are accessed in the following order:",
        "1. application-specific vocabulary supplied by the developer (either manually or by extraction from the linguistic servers).",
        "2. the core 3000-word vocabulary.",
        "3. the linguistic servers, if present.",
        "4.",
        "Finally, if the required information is not found in any of the linguistic resources, there are default assumptions for all linguistic information, to be described later.",
        "There are four linguistic servers, corresponding to the four major categories of lexical information used in our system: lexicon, knowledge base, denotations, and semantics."

        "Relatively little effort was needed to convert Comlex into a form usable by our system.",
        "A simple PERL program performed a conversion from the LISP syntax used for Comlex into Prolog, the language used for our system.",
        "Second, the features and subcategorizations represented in Comlex are encoded in terms of grammatical concepts first developed at NYU in the 1970's by Naomi Sager (Sager (1981)).",
        "The Unisys NLU system's syntactic component is based on Sager's work.",

        "of the University of Southern California.",
        "Concepts in WordNet do not have names -- they are just sets of words (called synsets).",
        "ISI has supplied mnemonic names for the WordNet synsets and made them generally available to the WordNet community.",
        "(Examples of some of the ISI concept names can be seen in Figure 2.)",
        "The WordNet concepts correspond to real-world entities and phenomena in terms of which people understand the meanings of words.",
        "Our knowledge base server is currently concerned with only the concepts corresponding to nouns, because our system makes little use of hierarchical information about other parts of speech.'",
        "There are about 60,000 of these noun concepts in WordNet, including ancestor concepts which provide a taxonomy to the concept set.",
        "Conversion of the WordNet KB was also straightforward.",
        "WordNet files in Prolog are part of the standard WordNet distribution.",
        "Therefore, the bulk of the task involved routine reformatting into the primitives of the Unisys NLU system.",
        "Our system already made use of a semantic network knowledge representation system known as M-PACK, a KL-ONE (Brachman and Schmolze (1985)) derivative which supports multiple inheritance.",
        "Our core system has a small M-PACK knowledge base, which we wanted to retain both to preserve compatibility with old applications and because it contained useful concepts which were not present in WordNet.",
        "To merge the two KBs, all we needed to do was to make each of the 11 unique beginners for WordNet noun hierarchies immediate children of appropriate concepts in our knowledge base.",
        "Making use of multiple inheritance, we also provided is-a links between selected WordNet synsets and the appropriate concepts in our small KB.",
        "For example, while our original KB contained a concept city_C, WordNet has two disjoint subtrees of cities (roughly corresponding to cities which are administrative centers such as capitals, and those which are not).",
        "By making both of these subtrees children of city_C we achieved the needed generalization, as shown in Figure 2."

        "For example, the verb abridge has an associated case frame consisting of an agent doing the abridging and an optional theme that is being abridged.",
        "Furthermore, in an English sentence using the verbribridge, the agent is typically found in the subject and the theme in the object.",
        "Words other than verbs can have similar information.",
        "The semantics server contains such information for about 4300 words, mostly verbs; the verbs account for over 60% of the verbs in Cornlex.",
        "There needs to be consistency between the information in the lexicon and semantics servers.",
        "For example, every verb which is declared to be ditransitive in Comlex should have a semantic rule mapping both the object and indirect object to distinct roles such as theme and goal.",
        "We developed a semi-automatic tool which examined every verb which had rules in the semantics server, and based on the lexical entry for that verb, added additional semantic rules to account for all of the verb's subcategorizations, or object options.",
        "These automatically fabricated rules were not always correct (the preposition against does not always imply an opposing force, for instance), but they were a good start.",
        "The most difficult manual task in reviewing these rules had to do with the issue of verb senses.",
        "Because verb senses are not separated in Comlex entries, the tool assumed that all the lexical subcategorizations of a verb applied to a single verb sense.",
        "When this was not the case, the semantic rules had to be divided into subsets for each individual sense, a process that we could not do automatically."

        "covered were for the most part instances of technical jargon for our domain2.",

        "The task of a developer of a particular natural language application is greatly simplified by the presence of these resources.",
        "In the future we plan to incorporate WordNet information for verbs into our KB server, and to",
        "add semantics rules for the remaining Comlex verbs into the semantics server.",
        "We also expect to augment the semantics server with semantic class constraints on the fillers of roles such as agent, and to create a fifth server, containing selection constraints."
