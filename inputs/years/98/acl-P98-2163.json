        "There has been a variety of definitions for coherence relations (see (Hovy and Maier, 1993) for a survey).",
        "However, the definitions are rather vague and they are often recognized to be underspecified (Moore and Pollack, 1992; Fukumoto and Tsujii, 1994).",
        "This paper attempts to explicate how such coherence relations arise between segments of discourse.",
        "We focus on te-linkage in Japanese – a translational equivalent of English and-linkage, since mere parataxis ranges over too widely to capture the underlying principles on the coherence relations.",
        "We consider that coherence relations are categories each of which has its prototypical instances and marginal ones.",
        "As with all instances of categorizations, the prototypical cases of each relation are clearly distinguishable from one another.",
        "In some cases, however, it is often hard to make clear argument for a relation being one rather than another.",
        "In addition, these relations themselves are hierarchically organized according to their specificity.",

        "In formal writing such as newspaper editorials, te ranks second (17.2%) after ren'yoo linkage (36.9%).",
        "The actual occurrence of te is much more frequent than these numbers suggest, because these data do not include cases in which the second predicate is a so-called auxiliary.",
        "states hold at the same time, while in the latter, two events occur successively.",
        "These two categories are further divided into smaller categories according to the event structures of conjuncts.",

        "When two events which are linked solely by temporal sequentiality are expressed via te-linkage, the conjuncts must share an agentive subject.",
        "Thus, causation and one person's volitional acts are sufficient to be recognized as togetherness.",
        "On the other hand, in order for the category of parallel occurrence of events to be compatible with te-linkage, they must be homogeneous in some sense.",
        "One such example is the case where a thing has two different properties (Additive) and another is the cases where two different things have similar properties or are engaged in similar events (Contrast).",

        "As for the Contrast relation, the subjects of the conjuncts must be different from each other and hence both of them are explicitly mentioned (often marked with the contrastive wa).",
        "In general, the similarities of the predicates appear as the syntactic parallelism as the example (6) shows.",
        "The other subcategory of the parallel occurrence of events is \"accompaniment,\" where the second clause is foregrounded and the first backgrounded.",
        "The prototypical instance of this category is the case where the first clause denotes a state and the second an event, since we have a tendency to focus on a changing event rather than stable state.",
        "Thus, the Circumstance relation composes this category.",
        "The cases where the first clause denotes some manner of event are also contained in this category, since a manner accompanies an event.",
        "The notion of the manner is continuous to the means since the means and manner of an event are often coextensive in that the means of an event often determines the manner of the event.",
        "This is exemplified by English with as well as Japanese de, which are used both as an instrumental or means marker and as a marker of manner (How is similarly poly-semous) (Goldberg, 1996).",
        "The Means-End relation is also continuous to causation, since the means can be interpreted as a kind of causation.",
