        "In this paper, we report on an effort to provide a general-purpose spoken language generation tool for Concept-to-Speech (CTS) applications by extending a widely used text generation package, FUF/SURGE, with an intonation generation component.",
        "As a first step, we applied machine learning and statistical models to learn intonation rules based on the semantic and syntactic information typically represented in FUF/SURGE at the sentence level.",
        "The results of this study are a set of intonation rules learned automatically which can be directly implemented in our intonation generation component.",
        "Through 5-fold cross-validation, we show that the learned rules achieve around 90% accuracy for break index, boundary tone and phrase accent and 80% accuracy for pitch accent.",
        "Our study is unique in its use of features produced by language generation to control intonation.",
        "The methodology adopted here can be employed directly when more discourse/pragmatic information is to be considered in the future."

        "Speech is rapidly becoming a viable medium for interaction with real-world applications.",
        "Spoken language interfaces to on-line information, such as plane or train schedules, through display-less systems, such as telephone interfaces, are well under development.",
        "Speech interfaces are also widely used in applications where eyes-free and hands-free communication is critical, such as car navigation.",
        "Natural language generation (NLG) can enhance the ability of such systems to communicate naturally and effectively by allowing the system to tailor, reorganize, or summarize lengthy database responses.",
        "For example, in our work on a multimedia generation system where speech and graphics generation techniques are used to automatically summarize patient's pre-, during, and post-, operation status to different caregivers (Dalai et al., 1996), records relevant to patient status can easily number in the thousands.",
        "Through content planning, sentence planning and lexical selection, ,the NLG component is able to provide a concise, yet informative, briefing automatically through spoken and written language coordinated with graphics (McKeown et al., 1997) .",
        "Integrating language generation with speech synthesis within a Concept-to-Speech (CTS) system not only brings the individual benefits of each; as an integrated system, CTS can take advantage of the availability of rich structural information constructed by the underlying NLG component to improve the quality of synthesized speech.",
        "Together, they have the potential of generating better speech than Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems.",
        "In this paper, we present a series of experiments that use machine learning to identify correlation between intonation and features produced by a robust language generation tool, the FUF/SURGE system (Elhadad, 1993; Robin, 1994).",
        "The ultimate goal of this study is to provide a spoken language generation tool based on FUF/SURGE, extended with an intonation generation component to facilitate the development of new CTS applications."

        "Two elements form the theoretical background of this work: the grammar used in FUF/SURGE and Pierrehumbert's intonation theory (Pierrehumbert, 1980).",
        "Our study aims at identifying the relations between the semantic/syntactic information produced by FUF/SURGE and four intonational features of Pierrehumbert: pitch accent, phrase accent, boundary tone and intermediate/intonational phrase boundaries.",
        "The FUF/SURGE grammar is primarily based on systemic grammar (Halliday, 1985).",
        "In systemic grammar, the process (ultimately realized as the verb) is the core of a clause's semantic structure.",
        "Obligatory semantic roles, called participants, are associated with each process.",
        "Usually, participants convey who/what is involved in the process.",
        "The process also has non-obligatory peripheral semantic roles called circumstances.",
        "Circumstances answer questions such as when/where/how/why.",
        "In FUF/SURGE, this semantic description is unified with a syntactic grammar to generate a syntactic description.",
        "All semantic, syntactic and lexical information, which are produced during the generation process, are kept in a final Functional Description (FD), before linearizing the syntactic structure into a linear string.",
        "The features used in our intonation model are mainly extracted from this final FD.",
        "The intonation theory proposed in (Pierrehumbert, 1980) is used to describe the intonation structure.",
        "Based on her intonation grammar, the FO pitch contour is described by a set of intonational features.",
        "The tune of a sentence is formed by one or more intonational phrases.",
        "Each intonational phrase consists of one or more intermediate phrases followed by a boundary tone.",
        "A well-formed intermediate phrase has one or more pitch accents followed by a phrase accent.",
        "Based on this theory, there are four features which are critical in deciding the FO contour: the placement of intonational or intermediate phrase boundaries (break index 4 and 3 in ToBI annotation convention (Beckman and Hirschberg, 1994)), the tonal type at these boundaries (the phrase accent and the boundary tone), and the FO local maximum or minimum (the pitch accent)."

        "Previous work on intonation modeling primarily focused on TTS applications.",
        "For example, in (Ba,chenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990), a set of hand-crafted rules are used to determine discourse neutral prosodic phrasing, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85%.",
        "Recently, researchers improved on manual development of rules by acquiring prosodic phrasing rules with machine learning tools.",
        "In (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992), Classification And Regression Tree (CART) (Brieman et al., 1984) was used to produce a decision tree to predict the location of prosodic phrase boundaries, yielding a high accuracy, around 90%.",
        "Similar methods were also employed in predicting pitch accent for TTS in (Hirschberg, 1993).",
        "Hirschberg exploited various features derived from text analysis, such as part of speech tags, information status (i.g.",
        "given/new, contrast), and cue phrases; both hand-crafted and automatically learned rules achieved 80-98% success depending on the type of speech corpus.",
        "Until recently, there has been only limited effort on modeling intonation for CTS (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988; Young and Fallside, 1979; Prevost, 1995).",
        "Many CTS systems were simplified as text generation followed by TTS.",
        "Others that do integrate generation make use of the structural information provided by the NLG component (Prevost, 1995).",

        "Previous TTS research results cannot be implemented directly in our intonation generation component.",
        "Many features studied in TTS are not provided by FUF/SURGE.",
        "For example, the part-of-speech (POS) tags in FUF/SURGE are different from those used in TTS.",

        "In order to model intonational features automatically, features from FUF/SURGE and a speech corpus are provided as input to a machine learning tool called RIPPER (Cohen, 1995), which produces a set of classification rules based on the training examples.",
        "The performance of RIPPER is comparable to benchmark decision tree induction systems such as CART and C4.5.",
        "We also employ a statistical method based on a generalized linear model (Chambers and Hastie, 1992) provided in the S package to select salient predictors for input to RIPPER.",

        "After this FD is unified with the syntactic grammar, SURGE, the resulting FD includes hundreds of semantic, syntactic and lexical features.",
        "We extract 13 features shown in Table 1 which are more closely related to intonation as indicated by previous research.",
        "We have chosen features which are applicable to most words to avoid unspecified values in the training data.",
        "For example, \"tense\" is not extracted simply because it can be only applied to verbs.",
        "Table 1 includes descriptions for each of the features used.",

        "The final corpus contains 258 sentences for each speaker, including 119 noun phrases, 37 of which have embeded sentences, and 139 sentences.",
        "The average sentence/phrase length is 5.43 words.",
        "The baseline performance achieved by always guessing the majority class is 67.09% for break index, 54.10% for pitch accent, 66.23% for phrase accent and 79.37% for boundary tone based on the speech corpus from one speaker.",
        "The relatively high baseline for boundary tone is because for most of the cases, there is only one L% boundary tone at the end of each sentence in our training data.",

        "We were also interested in finding out whether the 13 selected features are redundant in making intonation decisions.",
        "We started from a simple model which includes only 3 factors, the type of semantic constituent boundary before (BB) and after (BA) the word, and part of speech (POS).",
        "The semantic constituent boundary can take on 6 different values; for example, it can be a clause boundary, a boundary associated with a primary semantic role (e.g., a participant), with a secondary semantic role (e.g., a type of modifier), among others.",
        "Our purpose in this experiment was to test how well the model can do with a limited number of parameters.",
        "Applying RIPPER to the simple model yielded rules that significantly improved performance over the baseline models.",
        "For example, the accuracy of the rules learned for break index increases to 87.37% from 67.09%; the average improvement on all 4 intonational features is 19.33%.",

        "improvements over the simple model, and the new semantic model (containing the features SEMFUN, SP and GSP in addition to BB, BA and POS) also achieves some improvements over the syntactic model (containing GPOS, SYNFUN, SPPOS, SPGPOS and SPSYNFUN in addition to BB, BA and POS), but none of these improvements are statistically significant using binomial test.",
        "Finally, we ran an experiment using all 13 features, plus one intonational feature.",

        "Although RIPPER has the ability to select predictors for its rules which increase accuracy, it's not clear whether all the features in the RIPPER rules are necessary.",
        "Our first experiment seems to suggest that irrelevant features could damage the performance of RIPPER because the model with all features generally performs worse than the semantic model.",
        "Therefore, the purpose of the second experiment is to find the salient predictors and eliminate redundant and irrelevant ones.",
        "The result of this study also helps us gain a better understanding of the relations between FUF/SURGE features and intonation.",
        "Since the response variables, such as break index and pitch accent, are categorical values, a generalized linear model is appropriate.",
        "We mapped all intonation features into binary values as required in this framework (e.g., pitch accent is mapped to either \"accent\" or accent\").",

        "As shown in the \"selected features\" and \"dropped fea-tures\" column, almost half of the predictors are dropped (average number of factors dropped is 44.64%), and the new model achieves similar performance.",

        "The results show that \"speaker\" is consistently selected by the system as an important factor in all 4 models.",
