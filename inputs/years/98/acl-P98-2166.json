        "Considering some differences between PPAs and other kinds of anaphors, such as personal or demonstrative pronouns, we define three knowledge sources (KSs) for PPA resolution: surface patterns (taking in account factors such as syntactic parallelism), possessive relationship rules and sentence centering.",
        "These knowledge sources are organized in a blackboard architecture for PPA resolution, which provides both knowledge and procedure distribution among autonomous entities (reflexive agents), each of them specialized in a particular aspect of the problem solving.",
        "The proposal has been implemented and its results are discussed at the end of the work."

        "The paper is structured as follows.",

        "From the interpretation point of view, PPAs are widely different from other kinds of anaphors, such as personal or demonstrative pronouns.",
        "In this section we present some specific characteristics of Portuguese PPAs \"seu/sua/seus/suas\", by means of generic examples in natural language.",
        "Some of these examples, however, may be inappropriate in",
        "English version, when using pronouns \"his/her/ their/its\".",
        "First, we notice the lack of gender or number agreement between PPAs and their antecedents.",
        "The English version of example 1 has a trivial solution, based on syntactic constraints, but the Portuguese version is ambiguous: Ex 1: Jofto falou a Maria sobre seu cachorro.",
        "(John told Mary about his dog).",
        "Example 2 shows that PPAs can occur in several grammatical (usually, non-subject) positions.",
        "Besides, in example 3, we notice that PPAs can refer to different segments of a \"NP-of-NP-of-NP...\" chain.",
        "This kind of structure, with several NPs in the same chain, is typical in our domain.",
        "Ex 2: Joao viu um cachorro trazendo seu jornal I seu filhote.",
        "(John saw a dog bringing his newspaper I its puppy).",
        "Ex 3: 0 pai do garotinho vendeu sua casa.",
        "(The father of the little boy sold his house).",
        "0 dono do cdo vendeu seu carro I seu filhote.",
        "(The owner of the dog sold his car I its puppy).",
        "In some situations, PPAs like shown in example 2 and 3 can be solved by applying semantic knowledge, since PPAs establish possessive relationships (in concrete or figurative sense) between objects in discourse.",
        "For example, a human being can usually possess \"his car\", but a dog cannot.",
        "However, we have found in our corpus several PPAs, namely abstract anaphors, which cannot be particularly related to any semantic object.",
        "For example, we have PPAs such as \"their importance\", \"their relevance\", etc.",
        "Similarly, we have found also some abstract antecedents, such as \"the problem\", \"the importance\", etc.",
        "Finally, we notice that, in our corpus, we have to treat long and complex sentence structures, which are typical in the domain (laws) that we are dealing with.",
        "Thus, despite PPAs in our corpus are mostly (99%) intrasentential, there is a high number of candidates for each anaphor."

        "Since typical syntactic constraints are not suitable for PPA resolution, in our approach we have limited the role of syntactic knowledge to simple heuristic rules based on surface patterns.",
        "Surface patterns are typical expressions in the domain, which gave information about PPAs antecedents.",
        "To each relevant surface pattern, we have associated a heuristic rule.",
        "Some of these",
        "rules can directly elect, with high rate of success, the most probable antecedent, whereas others can only exclude a specific candidate: Fl - in the pattern <NP and I or PPA>, <NP> must be elected the most probable antecedent of <PPA>.",
        "Ex: \"John and his dog\"; F2 - in the pattern <of NP.. .of PPA>, <NP> must be elected the most probable antecedent of <PPA>.",
        "This rule deals with some cases of syntactic parallelism.",
        "Ex: \"the death of Suzy, of her children and...\"; F3 - in the patter <NP of PPA>, <NP> is not a valid candidate for <PPA>.",
        "Ex: in \"the death of his son\", \"death\" is not a valid candidate; F4 - in the pattern <NP of NP of NP... of NP>, only the full chain and the last NP can be considered candidates for PPAs antecedents, i.e., NPs in the middle of the chain can be discarded.",

        "For example, for the anaphor \"their hunt\" in our corpus, there is a semantic rule which expects only a member of the class <animals> as a suitable antecedent.",
        "Typical members of this class would be \"birds\", \"mammals\" and all related expressions found in our corpus.",

        "For these cases, and possibly for some other cases not included in previous rules, we suggest a pragmatic factor, adapted from S. Brennan's et al. (1987) centering algorithm.",
        "Although sentence center plays a crucial role in many works in anaphor resolution, usually limiting the number of candidates to be considered, we notice that, because PPAs can refer to almost any NP in the sentence (rather than, for example, personal pronouns, which are often related to the sentence center), pragmatic knowledge plays only a secondary - but still important - role in our approach.",
        "We have adapted basic aspects of center algorithm, considering subject/object preference, and domain concepts preference,",

        "Thus, in case of ambiguity among candidates (after applying factors Fl to F5), we will consider the estimated center as the preferable PPA antecedent.",
