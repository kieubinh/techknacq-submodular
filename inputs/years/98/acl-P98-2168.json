        "The view that communication is a form of action serving a variety of specific functions has had a tremendous impact on the philosophy of language and on computational linguistics.",
        "Yet, this mode of analysis has been applied to only a narrow range of exchanges (e.g. those whose primary purpose is transferring information or coordinating tasks) while exchanges meant to manage interpersonal relationships, maintain \"face\", or simply to convey thanks, sympathy, and so on have been largely ignored.",
        "We present a model of such \"social perlocutions\" that integrates previous work in natural language generation, social psychology, and communication studies.",
        "This model has been implemented in a system that generates socially appropriate email in response to user-specified communicative goals."

        "The importance of viewing utterances as not simply statements of fact but also as real actions (speech acts) with consequences has long been well understood (Searle, 1969; Austin 1975; Grice 1975).",
        "As a result, it is important to study not just the formal aspects of language forms but also how speakers use different forms to serve different functions.",
        "For example, one function of the act of informing another person is to make the person aware of a state of affairs; similarly, one function of promising is to secure the return of a favor.",
        "Unfortunately, the study of speech acts has been largely limited to the collection and classification of act types and the conditions for appropriate use of each type (Searle 1969; Wiersbicka 1987).",
        "The range of functions, or perlocutionary effects, served by different act types has been largely ignored.",
        "In particular, there has been little or no work on the impact that speech acts can have on social attitudes and behavior.",
        "Yet, without an account of how commu",
        "nication can affect social situations, it is impossible to construct systems that are capable of generating socially appropriate text.",
        "This paper provides a computational model of social perlocutions, and it describes how this model has been used to construct an automated system, LetterGen, for generating socially appropriate email messages and letters.",
        "This system takes general communicative and social goals from the user, such as demanding action or expressing congratulations, queries the user about subgoals and pertinent background information, and generates the text of an appropriate message by planning individual speech acts.",
        "As an example, Figure 1 shows a message generated by LetterGen in response to an input goal to decline an invitation politely.",
        "In this example, the writer was invited by the addressee to travel and give a talk, but the writer had a previous commitment and must decline.",
        "However, the writer knows some",
        "one who could give the talk in his place.",
        "The system planned a set of speech acts and realized each as a clause or phrase using a text template library.",
        "These acts include (1) thanking, (2) declining-request, (3) apologizing, (4) making-excuse, (5) advising, (6) assuring, and (7) requesting.",
        "Most of the text in the letter is devoted to addressing the writer's social goals of being polite and helpful.",
        "In contrast, a letter writer concerned only with informing the addresee that he was not participating would likely say little other than 9 won't be giving a talk at your event\", a socially inappropriate response."

        "Our work builds on results from three disparate areas: natural language generation (NLG), communication studies, and social psychology.",
        "The NLG community has focused on a small subset of the five generally accepted categories of speech acts (Levinson, 1983):",
        "1.",
        "Representatives – statements given as true depictions of the world (e.g., asserting, concluding).",
        "2.",
        "Directives – statements attempting to persuade the hearer to do something (e.g., ordering, advising, warning).",
        "3.",
        "Commissives – statements that commit the speaker to a course of action (e.g., promising, accepting a request, taking a side).",
        "4.",
        "Expressives – statements expressing a psychological state (e.g., apologizing, congratulating, condoling).",
        "5.",
        "Declarations – statements effecting an immediate change in the institutional state of affairs (e.g., christening, firing from employment).",
        "In particular, research in NLG has been limited to one type of representative (i.e., informing) and one type of directive (i.e., requesting), and it has further focused on informing's potential to convince the hearer of some fact and requesting's potential to persuade the hearer to do some action (Allen et al., 1994; Appelt, 1985; Bruce, 1975; Cohen and Per-rault, 1979; Hovy, 1988; Perrault and Allen, 1979).",
        "As a result, it has largely ignored speech acts in other categories, such as promising, advising, and crediting, as well as their potential perlocutionary effects of creating affinity between speaker and hearer, securing future favors for the speaker, and so on.",
        "In contrast, research in communication studies has explored strategies for persuading, creating affinity, comforting, and many other interpersonal goals (Daly and Wiemann, 1994; Marcu, 1997).",
        "For example, the strategies for persuading include not only requesting, but also exchange, ingratiation, and sanctions.",
        "However, these efforts have not analyzed these strategies in terms of speech act types and perlocutionary effects so that these strategies might be realized in computational form.",
        "Finally, research in social psychology has looked at how personality traits affect interpersonal interaction.",
        "For example, Kiesler (1983) formulated general rules for describing how one person expressing one trait (e.g., merciful) can lead to another person expressing a symmetric and complementary trait (e.g., appreciative).",
        "Such interaction dyads are directly mappable to the speaker/hearer dyad of speech act theory, and the vocabulary of trait terms and predictive rules suggest one way of lending organization to the great variety of perlocutionary effects.",
        "Yet, social psychologists have not mapped their general trait terms to the classes of speech acts that might express these traits.",
        "What's been lacking is an attempt to integrate the lessons learned from these different research efforts to provide an initial model of social perlocutions; that is, a model that describes how specific speech act types have the potential to produce specific effects in a hearer corresponding to a speaker's social goals, and that is specified formally enough to be used as part of text generation systems."

        "These links are potential because there are specific conditions associated with specific effects that dictate whether one effect will cause another.",

        "That is, a speech act directly results in beliefs about the content and intent of utterances and these beliefs indirectly result in changes to goals, emotions, and interpersonal relationships.",

Figure 3 is an example, showing these effects for apologizing.a Although not shown in Figure 3, the causal relationships between these effects have conditions attached to them.",
        "In Figure 3, for example, a condition on an apology leading to the hearer believing the speaker feels regret is that the hearer believes the speaker is sincere and there is an act for which",
        "an apology is appropriate.",
        "We draw our terminology for describing specific personality traits (e.g., likeable, conscientious) and emotions (e.g., gratitude, liking) from existing taxonomies (Kiesler, 1983; Ortony et al., 1988).",
        "Figure 3 shows effects with arrows leading to them from other speech acts, such as praising, warning, thanking, and so on.",
        "These speech acts are there to illustrate that speech acts are related through a web of interlocking effects.",
        "That is, the causal relationships between speech acts and effects is many-to-many: a single act can have many different effects and any single effect can be brought about by many different acts.",
        "For example, expressing a demand can bring about compliance, anger, or both, and similarly, anger can be caused by a variety of other acts, such as issuing a threat.",
        "In Figure 3, both praising and apologising are examples of acts that can increase the hearer's liking for the speaker, and both apologising and thanking can lead the hearer to believe the speaker is accountable.",

        "We are addressing both of these problems by exploring techniques for forming a detailed user profile and applying across a large set of generated letters.",
        "The other important limitation is that its organizational and text templates are not particularly flexible (e.g., they demand a specific speech act order and they realize each speech act as a single sentence).",
