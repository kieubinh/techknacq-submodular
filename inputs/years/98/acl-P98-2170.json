        "A common task of knowledge discovery is multiple concept learning, in which from multiple given classes (i.e. a typology) the profiles of these classes are inferred, such that every class is contrasted from every other class by feature values.",
        "Ideally, good profiles, besides making good predictions on future instances, should be concise, intelligible, and comprehensive (i.e. yielding all alternatives).",
        "Previous approaches like ID3 (Quinlan, 1983) or C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993), which use variations on greedy search, i.e. localized best-next-step search (typically based on information-gain heuristics), have as their major goal prediction on unseen instances, and therefore do not have as an explicit concern the conciseness, intelligibility, and comprehensiveness of the output.",
        "In contrast to virtually all previous approaches to multi-class discrimination, the MPD (Maximally Parsimonious Discrimination) program we describe here aims at the legibility of the resultant class profiles.",
        "To do so, it (1) uses a minimal number of features by carrying out a global optimization, rather than heuristic greedy search; (2) produces conjunctive, or nearly conjunctive, profiles for the sake of intelligibility; and (3) gives all alternative solutions.",
        "The first goal stems from the familiar",
        "requirement that classes be distinguished by jointly necessary and sufficient descriptions.",
        "The second accords with the also familiar thesis that conjunctive descriptions are more comprehensible (they are the norm for typological classification (Hempel, 1965), and they are more readily acquired by experimental subjects than disjunctive ones (Bruner et.",
        "al., 1956)), and the third expresses the usefulness, for a diversity of reasons, of having all alternatives.",
        "Linguists would generally subscribe to all three requirements, hence the need for a computational tool with such focus.' In this paper, we briefly describe the MPD system (details may be found in Valdes-Perez and Pericliev, 1997; submitted) and focus on some linguistic applications, including componential analysis of kinship terms, distinctive feature analysis in phonology, language typology, and discrimination of aphasic syndromes from coded texts in the CHILDES database.",

        "2 Overview of the MPD program The Maximally Parsimonious Discrimination program (MPD) is a general computational tool for inferring, given multiple classes (or, a typology), with attendant instances of these classes, the profiles (=descriptions) of these classes such that every class is contrasted from all remaining classes on the basis of feature values.",

        "The MPD program uses Boolean, nominal and numeric features to express contrasts, as follows:",
        "• Two classes Cl and C2 are contrasted by a Boolean or nominal feature if the instances of Cl and the instances of C2 do not share a value.",
        "• Two classes Cl and C2 are contrasted by a numeric feature if the ranges of the instances of Cl and of C2 do not overlap.2",
        "MPD distinguishes two types of contrasts: (1) absolute contrasts when all the classes can be cleanly distinguished, and (2) partial contrasts when no absolute contrasts are possible between some pairwise classes, but absolute contrasts can nevertheless be achieved by deleting up to N per cent of the instances, where N is specified by the user.",
        "The program can also invent derived features – in the case when no successful (absolute) contrasts are so far achieved – the key idea of which is to express interactions between the given primitive features.",
        "Currently we have implemented inventing novel derived features via combining two primitive features (combining three or more primitive features is also possible, but has not so far been done owing to the likelihood of a combinatorial explosion):",
        "• Two Boolean features P and Q are combined into a set of two-place functions, none of which is reducible to a one-place function or to the negation of another two-place function in the set.",
        "The resulting set consists of P-and-Q, P-or-Q, P-iff-Q, P-implies-Q, and Q-implies-P. • Two nominal features M and N are combined into a single two-place nominal function MxN.",
        "• Two numeric features X and Y are combined by forming their product and their quotient.3",
        "Both primitive and derived features are treated analogously in deciding whether two classes are contrasted by a feature, since derived features are legitimate Boolean, nominal or numeric features.",
        "It will be observed that contrasts by a nominal or numeric feature may (but will not necessarily) introduce a slight degree of disjunctiveness, which is to a somewhat greater extent the case in contrasts accomplished by derived features.",
        "Missing values do not present much problem, since they can be ignored without any need to estimate a value nor to discard the remaining informative features values of the instance.",
        "In the case of nominal features, missing values can be treated as just another legitimate feature value."

        "Thus, Class 5 is 66.6% NP1=phys-obj since we need to retract 1/3 of its instances (particularly, sentence (3) from Table 1 whose NP1=hum) in order to get a clean contrast by that feature.",
        "Class 1 (otglezdam) and Class 2 (zranja) use in their profiles the derived nominal feature NP lxNP2; they actually contrast because all instances of Class 1 have the value 'hum' for NP1 and the value 'beast' for NP2, and hence the \"derived value\" [hum beast], whereas neither of the instances of Class 2 has an identical derived value (indeed, referring to Table 1, the first instance of Class 2 has NP lxNP2=[hum hum] and the second instance NP1xNP2=[beast beast]).",
