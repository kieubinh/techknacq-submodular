        "In turn, the computational representation of a referring expression (RE) should have at least the following attributes:",
        "• RE.identificator – a number; • RE.position – uniquely identifies the RE's position in the text: number, paragraph, sentence, beginning and ending words; • RE.syntactic-information – a parse tree of the RE, the RE's function, or, if available, a parse tree of the whole sentence where the RE appears; • RE.semantic-information – a conceptual structure for the RE, or, if available, for the whole sentence.",

        "the RE is attached to the MR and the MR's structure is updated;",

        "The symmetrical operation, i.e., splitting an MR which confusingly represents two objects, is far more difficult to do, as it has to reverse a lot of decisions; • partition: MRa ---) MRa + MRnew(1) + MRnew(2) +...; • grouping: MRa + MRb MRa + MRb + MRnew(a,b);",
        "The last two operations (partition/grouping) are symmetrical, and prove necessary in order to deal with collections of objects (plurals).",
        "For instance, from a collective RE as \"the team\" (and its MR) the program has to use built-in knowledge to create several MRs corresponding to the players, and correctly solve the new RE \"the first player\".",
