        "An open, extendible multi-dictionary system is introduced in the paper.",
        "It supports the translator in accessing adequate entries of various bi and monolingual dictionaries and translation examples from parallel corpora.",
        "Simultaneously an unlimited number of dictionaries can be held open, thus by a single interrogation step, all the dictionaries (translations, explanations, synonyms, etc.)",
        "can be surveyed.",
        "The implemented system (called MoBiDic) knows morphological rules of the dictionaries' languages.",
        "Thus, never the actual (inflected) words, but always their lemmas – that is, the right dictionary entries – are looked up.",
        "MoBiDic has an open, multimedial architecture, thus it is suitable for handling not only textual, but speaking or picture dictionaries, as well.",
        "The same system is also able to find words and expressions in corpora, dynamically providing the translators with examples from their earlier translations or other translators' works.",
        "MoBiDic has been designed for translator workgroups, where the translators' own glossaries (built also with the help of the system) may also be disseminated among the members of the group, with different access rights, if needed.",
        "The system has a TCP/IP-based client-server implementation for various platforms and available with a gradually increasing number of dictionaries for numerous language pairs."

        "\"The whole world of translation is opening up, to new possibilities, and to technological and methodological change\" (Kingscott 1993).",
        "Some years after the above claim, we see that software tools for translators, even the most recent ones, do not yet guarantee perfect solutions to automatic translation.",
        "More and more systems introduce, however, new facilities to the translator working in a computational environment.",
        "As Hutchins says, \"the best use must be made of those systems that are available, and the producers and developers must be encouraged to improve and introduce new facilities to meet user needs.\" (Hutchins 1996) It is almost a commonplace that texts – books, newspapers, letters, official memos, brochures, any type of publications, reports, etc.",
        " – in the nineties are written, sent, read and translated with the help of the electronic media.",
        "Consequently, traditional information sources, like paper-based dictionaries, and lexicons, are no longer as much a part of the translation environment.",
        "Electronic dictionaries for most developers just mean, however, to make the well-known paper dictionary image appear on the computer screen.",
        "It is easy to understand why we say that dictionary computerization does not mean producing machine-readable versions of traditional printed dictionaries, but the combination of the existing lexical resources with up-to-date language technology.",
        "On the other hand, there is a question whether we have to continue in the traditional way of developing new – and different – lexicons for any new application/system, starting from scratch every time and therefore consuming time, money and manpower, or is it new lexicons.",
        "In what follows, timely to think of the possibility of making the effort to converge, trying to avoid unnecessary duplications and – where possible – building on what already exists (Calzolari 1994).",
        "Consequently, in the near future we have to combine the two above needs: making existing",
        "lexical resources computationally accessible and showing the strategy how to develop we try to argue for changes in development strategies of electronic translation dictionaries.",
        "Today's ling-ware technology can – and must – use dynamic actions, like morpho-syntactic analysis, lemmati-zation, spell checking, and so on.",
        "On the other hand, dictionaries can never be full in any sense, therefore we have to make parallel multi-dictionary access possible.",
        "It means that a single dictionary lookup should use an unlimited number of lexical resources that are available for the translator."

      "heading": "1 The MoBiDic Lookup System",
      "text": [
        "To start with the most natural activity concerning dictionaries is searching them for a single word.",
        "There is no problem if it can be found among the headwords of the dictionary, that is, when the input string can match.",
        "But sometimes the translator starts the lookup process by clicking an inflected word-form of an open document that cannot be found among the headwords.",
        "For the user it is a boring and time-consuming task to type the lexical form, that is, the one accepted letter-by-letter by the dictionary.",
        "To make the system able to find the stem of the input word-form automatically, MoBiDic uses a lemmatizer that provides the dictionary lookup module with the stem(s) to be found (Figure 1).",
        "Translators frequently want to find the word as a part of multi-word expressions or idioms.",
        "If the user does not know whether the actual word is part of some phrasal compound or idiom, the traditional paper dictionaries are very difficult to use.",
        "Namely, if the word in question is the so-called headword of a multi-word expression, it can be found easily.",
        "In case it is not the headword, one has to know the phrasal compound the word is a part of, but it is a typical \"Catch 22\" situation: if the expression is known why to search the dictionary for it?",
        "MoBiDic helps the user to find all the multi-word expressions containing the actual word's stem, independently whether it is a headword or not.",
        "E.g. not only 'lead' but both 'dog' and 'life' provide us (among others) with the multi-word expression 'lead a dog's life' that can be found under 'lead' only in a paper dictionary.",
        "In other words, users of the traditional dictionaries",
        "Lookup of a morphologically complex inflected form: `ausgegangen' in a German – Hungarian dictionary.",
        "are supposed to know the expression (what's more: the keyword of the expression) to find it in the lexicon.",
        "Search for 'lead a dog's life' through its components gives the following result in MoBiDic:",
        "73i' is somewhat misleading in the name MoBiDic.",
        "Bilingual in this sense means that the source and the target language are not the same types of object for the program.",
        "For MoBiDic, source language is the language the morphology of which has to be known, to provide the user with adequate output.",
        "The output is expected to be in the target language – the characters, the alphabetic order, etc.",
        "of which has to be known to make the hits appear on the screen in adequate format.",
        "Of course, the source and target languages can be the same, e.g. in explanatory or etymological dictionaries (Figure 2).",
        "There is an another sort of monolingual dictionary, the synonym dictionary.",
        "The translator frequently wants to use a synonym (antonym, hy-peniym, hyponym) of the actual word.",
        "An intelligent software tool, like MorphoLogic's Helyettel, is the combination of a thesaurus (synonym dictionary), a morphological analyzer and a generator, because the output is re-inflected according to the morphological information contained by the input word-form.",
        "The – so-called inflectional – thesaurus works as follows:",
        "There are special sorts of information in a dictionary.",
        "For example, pronunciation is not typically needed for translation, but can be useful for language learners.",
        "Pronunciation of the word is, therefore, an information that should be switched on and off, according to the user's needs.",
        "In an electronic dictionary it is expected that not only the written phonetic transcription, but also the spoken output can be heard.",
        "If the dictionary supports multimedia, explanatory pictures can help understand the word, even for professionals, not for language learners only (Fig.",
        "3).",
        "If the translator makes a spelling error, first a speller starts, and then the corrected word-form is sent to the dictionary lookup system.",
        "Examples do belong to the entries of large, professional paper dictionaries.",
        "In electronic dictionaries occurrences of the word in texts of other authors, or wants to see bilingual texts with their aligned translations: monolingual or aligned bilingual corpus, a free text search module and a lemmatizer."

        "Currently, if all the available dictionaries are open, MoBiDic handles approximately 1 million lexical entries.",

        "Dictionaries shown by Figure 1 and Figure 2, however, appear on the screen with the traditional paper dictionary image.",

        "Generally, the original lexical resource – even it has been available in electronic format – did not use SGML.",
        "For this reason, a special system for a semi-automatic conversion of some formatted text files containing dictionary data to SGML format has been developed for the MoBiDic environment.",
        "This system is not available for the end-users, it serves industrial purposes.2 First, in order to enable selective access to the information in dictionary entries, a thorough structural analysis is done, while inconsistent and faulty entries are marked.",
