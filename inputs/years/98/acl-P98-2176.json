        "Based on this correlation, we have developed a technique for automatic lexical choice of descriptions of entities in text generation.",
        "We discuss the underlying relationship between the pragmatics of choosing an appropriate description that serves a specific purpose in the automatically generated text and the semantics of the description itself.",
        "We present our work in the framework of the more general concept of reuse of linguistic structures that are automatically extracted from large corpora.",

        "Human writers constantly make deliberate decisions about picking a particular way of expressing a certain concept.",
        "These decisions are made based on the topic of the text and the effect that the writer wants to achieve.",
        "Such contextual and pragmatic constraints are obvious to experienced writers who produce context-specific text without much effort.",
        "However, in order for a computer to produce text in a similar way, either these constraints have to be added manually by an expert or the system must be able to acquire them in an automatic way.",
        "An example related to the lexical choice of an appropriate nominal description of a person should make the above clear.",
        "Even though it seems intuitive that Bill Clinton should always be described with the NP \"U. S. president\" or a variation thereof, it turns out that many other descriptions appear in on-line news stories that characterize him in light of the topic of the article.",
        "For example, an article from 1996 on elections uses \"Bill Clinton, the democratic presidential candidate\", while a 1997 article on a false bomb alert in Little Rock, Ark.",
        "uses \"Bill Clinton, an Arkansas native\".",
        "This paper presents the results of a study of the correlation between named entities (people, places, or organizations) and noun phrases used to describe them in a corpus.",
        "Intuitively, the use of a description is based on a deliberate decision on the part of the author of a piece of text.",
        "A writer is likely to select a description that puts the entity in the context of the rest of the article.",
        "It is known that the distribution of words in a document is related to its topic (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "We have developed related techniques for approximating pragmatic constraints using words that appear in the immediate context of the entity.",
        "We will show that context influences the choice of a description, as do several other linguistic indicators.",
        "Each of the indicators by itself doesn't provide enough empirical data that distinguishes among all descriptions that are related to a an entity.",
        "However, a carefully selected combination of such indicators provides enough information in order pick an appropriate description with more than 80% accuracy.",
        "Section 2 describes how we can automatically obtain enough constraints on the usage of descriptions.",
        "In Section 3, we show how such constructions are related to language reuse.",
        "In Section 4 we describe our experimental setup and the algorithms that we have designed.",
        "Section 5 includes a description of our results.",

        "Text generation usually involves lexical choice - that is, choosing one way of referring to an entity over another.",
        "Lexical choice refers to a variety of decisions that have to made in text generation.",
        "For example, picking one among several equivalent (or newly equivalent) constructions is a form of lexical choice (e.g., \"The Utah Jazz handed the Boston Celtics a defeat\" vs. \"The Utah Jazz defeated the Boston Celtics\" (Robin, 1994)).",
        "We are interested in a different aspect of the problem: namely learning the rules that can be used for automatically selecting an appropriate description of an entity in a specific",
        "context.",
        "To be feasible and scaleable, a technique for solving a particular case of the problem of lexical choice must involve automated learning.",
        "It is also useful if the technique can specify enough constraints on the text to be generated so that the number of possible surface realizations that match the semantic constraints is reduced significantly.",
        "The easiest case in which lexical choice can be made is when the full surface structure can be used, and when it has been automatically extracted from a corpus.",
        "Of course, the constraints on the use of the structure in the generated text have to be reasonably similar to the ones in the source text.",
        "We have found that a natural application for the analysis of entity-description pairs is language reuse, which includes techniques of extracting shallow structure from a corpus and applying that structure to computer-generated texts.",
        "Language reuse involves two components: a source text written by a human and a target text, that is to be automatically generated by a computer, partially making use of structures reused from the source text.",
        "The source text is the one from which particular surface structures are extracted automatically, along with the appropriate syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic constraints under which they are used.",
        "Some examples of language reuse include collocation analysis (Smadja, 1993), the use of entire factual sentences extracted from corpora (e.g., \"Toy Story' is the Academy Award winning animated film developed by Pixar\"), and summarization using sentence extraction (Paice, 1990; Kupiec et al., 1995).",
        "In the case of summarization through sentence extraction, the target text has the additional property of being a subtext of the source text.",
        "Other techniques that can be broadly categorized as language reuse are learning relations from on-line texts (Mitchell, 1997) and answering natural language questions using an on-line encyclopedia (Kupiec, 1993).",
        "Stydying the concept of language reuse is rewarding because it allows generation systems to leverage on texts written by humans and their deliberate choice of words, facts, structure.",
        "We mentioned that for language reuse to take",
        "place, the generation system has to use the same surface structure in the same syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic context as the source text from which it was extracted.",
        "Obviously, all of this information is typically not available to a generation system.",
        "There are some special cases in which most of it can be automatically computed.",
        "Descriptions of entities are a particular instance of a surface structure that can be reused relatively easily.",
        "Syntactic constraints related to the use of descriptions are modest - since descriptions are always noun phrases that appear as either pre-modifiers or appositions2, they are quite flexibly usable in any generated text in which an entity can be modified with an appropriate description.",
        "We will show in the rest of the paper how the requisite semantic (i.e., \"what is the meaning of the description to pick\") and pragmatic constraints (i.e., \"what purpose does using the description achieve?\")",
        "can be extracted automatically.",
        "Given a profile like the one shown in Table 1, and an appropriate set of semantic constraints (columns 2-7 of the table), the generation component needs to perform a profile lookup and select a row (description) that satisfies most or all semantic constraints.",
        "For example, if the semantic constraints specify that the description has to include the country and the political position of Ung Huot, the most appropriate description is \"Cambodian foreign minister\"."
