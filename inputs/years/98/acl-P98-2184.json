        "If there is no preceding discourse, then there is no preexisting topic to keep in subject position.",

        "The increase in zero anaphora (not overtly mentioning understood arguments) is caused by two factors.",
        "Generally, as the amount of surrounding context increases (going from single sentence to connected discourse) the need to overtly express all of the arguments with a verb decreases.",
        "Verbs that can describe actions (agree, disappear, escape, follow, leave, sing, wait) were typically used with some form of argument in single sentences, such as: \"I had a test that day, so I really wanted to escape from school.\" (CFJCF data).",
        "Such verbs were more likely to be used without any arguments in connected discourse as in: \"She escaped , crawled through the usual mine fields, under barbed wire, was shot at, swam a river, and we finally picked her up in Linz.\" (Brown Corpus) In this case, the argument of \"escaped\", (\"imprisonment\") was understood from the previous sentence.",
        "Verbs of propositional attitude (agree, guess, know, see, understand) are typically used transitively in written corpora and single-sentence production: \"I guessed the right answer on the quiz.\" (CFJCF).",
