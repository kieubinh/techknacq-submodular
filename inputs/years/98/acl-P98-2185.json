        "In this paper we discuss ROSE, an interactive approach to robust interpretation developed in the context of the JANUS speech-to-speech translation system (Lavie et al., 1996).",
        "Previous interactive approaches to robust interpretation have either required excessive amounts of interaction (Rosé and Waibel, 1994), depended upon domain dependent repair rules (Van Noord, 1996; Daniell and Gerbino, 1995), or relied on the minimum distance parsing approach (Hipp, 1992; Smith, 1992; Lehman, 1989) which has been shown to be intractable in a large-scale system (Rose and Lavie, 1997).",
        "In contrast, the ROSE approach operates efficiently without any hand-coded repair knowledge.",
        "An empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of this domain independent approach.",
        "A further evaluation demonstrates that the ROSE approach combines easily with available domain knowledge in order to improve the quality of the interaction.",
        "The ROSE approach is based on a model of human communication between speakers of different languages with a small shared language base.",
        "Humans who share a very small language base are able to communicate when the need arises by simplifying their speech patterns and negotiating until they manage to transmit their ideas to one another (Hatch, 1983).",
        "As the speaker is speaking, the listener \"casts his net\" in order to catch those fragments of speech that are comprehensible to him, which he then attempts to fit together semantically.",
        "His subsequent negotiation with the speaker builds upon this partial understanding.",
        "Similarly, ROSE repairs extragrammatical input in two phases.",
        "The first phase, Repair Hypothesis Formation, is responsible for assembling a set of hypotheses about the meaning of the ungrammatical utterance.",
        "In the second phase, Interaction with the User, the sys-tern generates a set of queries, negotiating with the speaker in order to narrow down to a single best meaning representation hypothesis.",
        "This approach was evaluated in the context of the JANUS multilingual machine translation system.",
        "First, the system obtains a meaning representation for a sentence uttered in the source language.",
        "Then the resulting meaning representation structure is mapped onto a sentence in the target language using GENKIT (Tomita and Nyberg, 1988) with a sentence level generation grammar.",
        "Currently, the translation system deals with the scheduling domain where two speakers attempt to schedule a meeting together over the phone.",
        "This paper focuses on the Interaction phase.",
        "Details about the Hypothesis Formation phase are found in (Rose, 1997)."

        "This phase is itself divided into two stages, Partial Parsing and Combination.",
        "The Partial Parsing stage is similar to the concept of the listener \"casting his net\" for comprehensible fragments of speech.",
        "A robust skipping parser (Lavie, 1995) is used to obtain an analysis for islands of the speaker's sentence.",
        "In the Combination stage, the fragments from the partial parse are assembled into a ranked set of alternative meaning representation hypotheses.",
        "A genetic programming (Koza, 1992; Koza, 1994) approach is used to search for different ways to combine the fragments in order to avoid requiring any hand-crafted repair rules.",

        "Inspired by (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Clark and Schaefer, 1989), the goal of the Interaction Phase is to minimize collaborative effort between the system and the speaker while maintaining a high level of interpretation accuracy.",
        "It uses this principle in determining which portions of the speaker's utterance to question.",
        "Thus, it focuses its interaction on those portions of the speaker's meaning that it is particularly uncertain about.",
        "In its questioning, it attempts to display the state of the system's understanding, acknowledging information conveyed by the speaker as it becomes clear.",
        "The interaction process can be summarized as follows: The system first assesses the state of its understanding of what the speaker has said by extracting features that distinguish the top set of hypotheses from one another.",
        "It then builds upon this understanding by cycling through the following four step process: selecting a feature; generating a natural language query from this feature; updating its list of alternative hypotheses based on the user's answer; and finally updating its list of distinguishing features based on the remaining set of alternative hypotheses."
