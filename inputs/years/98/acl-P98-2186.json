        "Learning problems in the natural language domain often map the text to a space whose dimensions are the measured features of the text, e.g., its words.",
        "Two characteristic properties of this domain are that its dimensionality is very high and that both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature space.",
        "In this paper we present a learning algorithm and an architecture with properties suitable for this domain.",
        "The SNOW algorithm presented here builds on recently introduced theories of multiplicative weight-updating learning algorithms for linear functions.",
        "Multiplicative weight-updating algorithms such as Winnow (Littlestone, 1988) and Weighted Majority (Littlestone and War-muth, 1994) have been studied extensively in the COLT literature.",
        "Theoretical analysis has shown that they have exceptionally good behavior in the presence of irrelevant attributes, noise, and even a target function changing in time (Littlestone, 1988; Littlestone and War-muth, 1994; Herbster and Warmuth, 1995).",
        "Only recently have people started to test these claimed abilities in applications.",
        "We address these claims empirically by applying SNOW to one of the fundamental disambiguation problems in natural language: part-of speech tagging.",
        "Part of Speech tagging (POS) is the problem of assigning each word in a sentence the part of speech that it assumes in that sentence.",
        "The importance of the problem stems from the fact that POS is one of the first stages in the process performed by various natural language related processes such as speech, information extraction and others.",
        "The architecture presented here, SNOW, is a Sparse Network Of Linear separators which utilizes the Winnow learning algorithm.",
        "A target node in the network corresponds to a candidate in the disambiguation task; all subnet-works learn autonomously from the same data in an online fashion, and at run time, they compete for assigning the correct meaning.",
        "A similar architecture which includes an additional layer is described in (Golding and Roth, 1998).",
        "The POS problem suggests a special challenge to this approach.",
        "First, the problem is a multi-class prediction problem.",
        "Second, determining the POS of a word in a sentence may depend on the POS of its neighbors in the sentence, but these are not known with any certainty.",
        "In the SNOW architecture, we address these problems by learning at the same time and from the",
        "same input, a network of many classifiers.",
        "Each sub-network is devoted to a single POS tag and learns to separate its POS tag from all others.",
        "At run time, all classifiers are applied simultaneously and compete for deciding the POS of this word.",
        "We present an extensive set of experiments in which we study some of the properties that SNOW exhibits on this problem, as well as compare it to other algorithms.",
        "In our first experiment, for example, we study the quality of the learned classifiers by, artificially, supplying each classifier with the correct POS tags of its neighbors.",
        "We show that under these conditions our classifier is almost perfect.",
        "This observation motivates an improvement in the algorithm which aims at trying to gradually improve the input supplied to the classifier.",
        "We then perform a preliminary study of learning the POS tagger in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "We show that we can reduce the requirements from the training corpus to some degree, but do not get good results, so far, when it is trained in a completely unsupervised fashion.",
        "Unlike most of the algorithms tried on this and other disambiguation tasks, SNOW is an online learning algorithm.",
        "That is, during training, every example is used once to update the learned hypothesis, and is then discarded.",
        "While on-line learning algorithms may be at disadvantage because they see each example only once, the algorithms are able to adapt to testing examples by receiving feedback after prediction.",
        "We evaluate this claim for the POS task, and discover that indeed, allowing feedback while testing, significantly improves the performance of SNO Won this task.",
        "Finally, we compare our approach to a state-of-the-art tagger, based on Brill's transformation based approach; we show that SNOW-based taggers already achieve results that are comparable to it, and outperform it, when we allow online update.",
        "Our work also raises a few methodological questions with regard to the way we measure the performance of algorithms for solving this problem, and improvements that can be made by better defining the goals of the tagger.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We start by presenting the SNOW approach.",
        "We then describe our test task, POS tagging, and the way we model it, and in Section 5 we describe our experimental studies.",
        "We conclude by discussing the significance of the approach to future research on natural language inferences.",

        "Links from the first to the second layer have weights; each target node is thus defined as a (linear) function of the lower level nodes.",
        "For example, in POS, target nodes correspond to different part-of-speech tags.",
        "Each target node can be thought of as an autonomous network, although they all feed from the same input.",
        "The network is sparse in that a target node need not be connected to all nodes in the input layer.",
        "For example, it is not connected to input nodes (features) that were never active with it in the same sentence, or it may decide, during training, to disconnect itself from some of the irrelevant input nodes, if they were not active often enough.",
        "Learning in SNOW proceeds in an online fashion.",
        "Every example is treated autonomously by each target subnetworks.",
        "It is viewed as a positive example by a few of these and a negative example by the others.",
        "In the applications described in this paper, every labeled example is treated as positive by the target node corresponding to its label, and as negative by all others.",
        "Thus, every example is used once by all the nodes to refine their definition in terms of the others and is then discarded.",
        "At prediction time, given an input sentence s (xi, z2, z,„), (i.e., activating a subset of the input nodes) the information propagates through all the competing subnetworks; and the one which produces the highest activity gets to determine the prediction.",

        "In recent years, a number of approaches have been tried for solving the problem.",
        "The most notable methods are based on Hidden Markov Models(HMM)(Kupiec, 1992; Schiitze, 1995), transformation rules(Brill, 1995; Brill, 1997), and multilayer neural networks(Schmid, 1994).",
        "HMM taggers use manually tagged training data to compute statistics on features.",
        "For example, they can estimate lexical probabilities Prob(wordltag) and contextual probabilities Prob(tagiprevious n tags).",

        "Phrased differently, the application of the condition to a given sentence s, checks whether the corresponding feature is active in this sentence.",

        "For example, in part of speech tagging, labeling a word with a part of speech changes the conditions of the following word that depend on that part of speech(e.g., the preceding word tag is t).",

        "Some are related to further studying this approach, based on multiplicative update algorithms, and using it for other natural language problems.",
        "More fundamental, we believe, are those that are concerned with the general learning paradigm the SNOW architecture proposes.",
        "A large number of different kinds of ambiguities are to be resolved simultaneously in performing any higher level natural language inference (Cardie, 1996).",
        "Naturally, these processes, acting on the same input and using the same \"memory\", will interact.",
        "In SNOW, a collection of classifiers are used; all are learned from the same data, and share the same \"memory\".",
        "In the study of SNOW we embark on the study of some of the fundamental issues that are involved in putting together a large number of classifiers and investigating the interactions among them, with the hope of making progress towards using these in performing higher level inferences."
