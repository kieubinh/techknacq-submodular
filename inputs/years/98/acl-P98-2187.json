        "Investigations within the generative perspective aim at modelling, by means of a small number of rules, principles and constraints, linguistic phenomena at a high level of abstraction, level which seems to be appropriate for research on multi-linguism and language learning.",
        "Among works within the generative perspective, one of the most innovative is the Generative Lexicon (GL) (Pustejovsky 91, 95) which introduces an abstract model opposed to sense enumeration lexicons.",
        "The GL is based (1) on the close cooperation of three lexical semantic structures: the argument structure, the aspectual structure and the Qualia structure (with four roles: Telic, Agentive, Constitutive and Formal), (2) on a detailed type theory and a type coercion inference rule and (3) on a refined theory of compositionality.",
        "The Generative Lexicon investigates the problem of polysemy and of the multiplicity of usages from a core sense of a lexeme and shows how these usages can be analyzed in terms of possible type shiftings w.r.t.",
        "the type expected by the core usage.",
        "Type shifting is modelled by a specific inference mechanism: type coercion.",
        "In this paper, the following points are addressed:",
        "• Generative systems require a clear analysis of the notions of word-sense and of sense delimitation.",
        "Depending on the strategy adopted (e.g. large number of narrow senses for a lexeme as in WordNet, or very few but large senses as in many Al works), the nature and the scope of generative operations may be very different.",
        "• The Qualia structure is a complex structure, quite difficult to describe, in spite of evidence",
        "of its existence, in particular for the Telic role, (explored e.g. in the EuroWordNet project, the European WordNet).",
        "Qualias are well-designed and useful for nouns, but look more artificial for other lexical categories.",
        "We show that it is the telic role of nouns which is the most useful.",
        "We also show how the internal structure of this role can be made more precise and its use more reliable and accurate by means of types and how it can be partitioned by means of types into ontological domains for modelling some forms of metaphors.",
        "• Types are not sufficiently 'constrained' to account for the constraints holding, for each predicate, on the different sense/usage variations they may be subject to.",
        "We show that an underspecified Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) (Jackendoff 90) is more appropriate because of its ability to represent underspecified meaning and therefore the polymorphism of senses in the GL, because of the relevance and low-granularity of its primitives (that we have slightly enhanced).",
        "• Elements of the Qualia structure can be incorporated into semantic composition rules to make explicit the semantics of the combination predicate-argument, instead of developing lexical redundancy rules.",
        "• A rule-based approach (also used by other authors such as (Copestake and Briscoe 95), (Ostler and Atkins 92), (Numberg and Zaenen 79)) is contrasted with the Qualia-based approach to deal with sense shiftings and in particular selective binding, metaphors (that the GL cannot resolve a priori) and metonymies.",
        "Another view is presented in (Jackendoff 97) with the principle of enriched composition, which is in fact quite close to our view, but restricted to a few specific coercion situations (aspectual, mass-count, picture, begin-enjoy).",
        "• The rules for type shifting we present here are not lexical rules, as in (Copestake and Briscoe 95), but they are part of the semantic composi",
        "tion system, which makes them more general.",
        "This paper is devoted to adjectival modification (see also (Bouillon 97, 98)).",
        "The goal is to study the use and impact of the Qualia structure of the modified noun in the determination of the semantic representation of the association Noun + Adjective.",
        "To illustrate this study, we have chosen one of the most polysemic French adjectives: bon (good), which covers most of the main situations.",
        "Other adjectives, often cited in the GL literature, such as sad, fast, difficult or noisy have been studied and confirm this analysis.",
        "We observed also many similarities within semantic families of adjectives."

        "Let us assume that any noun which can be modified by bon has a telic role in which the main function(s) of the object is described (e.g. execute programmes for a computer, run for a car 5), then the semantics of the compound adjective + noun can be defined as follows: Let N be a noun of semantic type a, and of Qualia: [ Telic: T, ...] where T denotes the set of predicates associated with the telic role of the noun N. Let Y the variable associated with N and let us assume that T is a list of predicates of the form F1(_, 4.",
