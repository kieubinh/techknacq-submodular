        "This selection must also take into consideration the degree of connectivity among the chosen text portions so as to minimize the danger of producing summaries which contain poorly linked sentences.",

        "Lexical cohesion has been widely used in text analysis for the comparative assessment of saliency and connectivity of text fragments.",
        "Following Hoey (1991), a simple way of computing lexical cohesion in a text is to segment the text into units (e.g sentences) and to count non-stop words1 which co-occur in each pair of distinct text units, as shown in Table 2 for the text in Table 1.",
        "Text units which contain a greater number of shared non-stop words are more likely to provide a better abridgement of the original text for two reasons:",
        "• the more often a word with high informational content occurs in a text, the more topical and germane to the text the word is likely to be, and • the greater the number of times two text units share a word, the more connected they are likely to be.",
        "Text saliency and connectivity for each text unit is therefore established by summing the number of shared words associated with the text unit.",
        "According to Hoey, the number of links (e.g. shared words) across two text units must be above a certain threshold for the two text units to achieve a lexical cohesion rank.",
        "For example, if only individual scores greater than 2 'Non-stop words can be intuitively thought of as words which have high informational content.",
        "They usually exclude words with a very high fequency of occurrence, especially closed class words such as determiners, prepositions and conjunctions (Fox, 1992)."

        "As Hoey points out, additional techniques can be used to refine the assessment of lexical cohesion.",
        "A typical example is the use of thesaurus functions such as synonymy and hy-ponymy to extend the notion of word sharing across text units, as exemplified in Hirst and St-C)nge (1997) and Baallay and Elhadad (1997) with reference to WordNet (Miller et al. 1990).",
        "Such an extension may improve on the assess-naent of textual saliency and connectivity thus providing better generic summaries, as argued in Barzilay and Elhadad (1997).",

        "First, the basic algorithm requires that (0 all unique pairwise permutations of distinct text units be processed, and (ii) all cross-sentence word combinations be evaluated for each such text unit pair.",
        "The complexity of this algorithm will therefore be 0(n2 * m2) for n text units in a text and m words in a text unit of average length in the text at hand.",

        "Thesaural relations such as synonymy and hyponymy are meant to capture word similarity in order to assess lexical cohesion among text units, and not to provide a thematic characterization of text units.2 Consequently, it will not be possible to index and retrieve text units in term of topic aptness according to users' needs.",
        "In the remaining part of the paper, we will show how these concerns of efficiency and thematic characterization can be addressed with specific reference to a system performing generic and query-based indicative 2Notice incidentally that such thematic characterization could not be achieved using thesauri such as WordNet since since WordNet does not provide an arrangement of synonym sets into classes of discourse topics (e.g. finance, sport, health).",
