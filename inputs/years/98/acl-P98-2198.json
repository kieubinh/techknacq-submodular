        "We present a method for constructing, maintaining and consulting a database of proper nouns.",

        "They are formalized by finite state transducers (FST) and large coverage dictionaries and are applied to a corpus of newspapers.",
        "We take into account synonymy and hyperonymy.",
        "This first stage of our parsing procedure has a high degree of accuracy.",
        "We show how we can handle requests such as: 'Find all newspaper articles in a general corpus mentioning the French prime minister', or 'How is Mr. X referred to in the corpus; what have been his different occupations through out the period over which our corpus extends?'",
        "In the first case, non trivial occurrences of noun phrases are located, that is phrases not containing words present in the request, but either synonyms, or proper nouns relevant to request.",
        "The results of the search is far better than than those obtained by a keyword based engine.",
        "Most answers are correct: except some cases of homonymy (where a human reader would also fail without more context).",
        "Also, the treatment of people having several different occupations is not fully resolved.",
        "We have built for French, a library of about one thousand such FSTs, and English FSTs are under construction.",
        "The same method can be used to locate and propose new proper nouns, simply by replacing given proper names in the same FSTs by variables."

        "Information Retrieval in full texts is one of the challenges of the next years.",
        "Web engines attempt to select among the millions of existing Web Sites, those corresponding to some input request.",
        "Newspaper archives is another exam-pie: there are several gigabytes of news on electronic support, and the size is increasing every day.",
        "Different approaches have been proposed to retrieve precise information in a large database of natural texts:",
        "1.",
        "Keywords algorithms (e.g. Yahoo): co-occurrences of the different words of the request are searched for in one same document.",
        "Generally, slight variations of spelling are allowed to take into account grammatical endings and typing errors.",
        "2.",
        "Exact pattern algorithms (e.g. OED): sequences containing occurrences described by a regular expression on characters are located.",
        "3.",
        "Statistical algorithms (e.g. LiveTopic):",
        "they offer to the user documents containing words of the request and also words that are statistically and semantically close with respect of clustering or factorial analysis.",
        "The first method is the simplest one: it generally provides results with an important noise (documents containing homographs of the words of the request, not in relation with the request, or documents containing words that have a form very close to that of the request, but with a different meaning).",
        "The second method yields excellent results, to the extent that the pattern of the request is sufficiently complex, and thus allows specification of synonymous forms.",
        "Also, the different grammatical endings can be described precisely.",
        "The drawback of such precision is the difficulty to build and handle complex requests.",
        "The third approach can provide good results for a very simple request.",
        "But, as any statistical method, it needs documents of a huge size, and thus, cannot take into account words occurring a limited number of times in the database,",
        "which is the case of roughly one word out of two, according Zipf's lawl(Zipf, 1932).",
        "We are particularly interested in finding noun phrases containing or referring to proper nouns, in order to answer the following requests:",
        "1. Who is John Major?",
        "2.",
        "Find all document referring to John Major.",
        "3.",
        "Find all people, who have been French ministers of culture.",
        "The statistical approach will probably succeed (supposing the text is large enough) in associating the words John Major, with the words Britain, prime and minister.",
        "Therefore, it would provide documents containing the sequence 'the prime minister, John Major', but also 'the French prime minister' or 'Timothy Eggar, Britain's energy minister' which have exactly the same number of correctly associated words.",
        "Such answers are an inevitable consequence of any method not grammatically founded.",
        "M. Gross and J. Senellart (1998) have proposed a preprocessing step of the text which groups up to 50 % of the words of the text into compound utterances.",
        "By hiding irrelevant meanings of simple words which are part of compounds, they obtain more relevant tokens.",
        "In the preceding example, the minimal tokens would be the compound nouns 'prime minister' or 'energy minis-ter', thus, the statistical engine could not have misinterpreted the word 'minister' in 'energy minister' and in 'prime minister'.",
        "We propose here a new method based on a formal and full description of the specific phrases actually used to describe occupations.",
        "We also use large coverage dictionaries, and libraries of general purpose finite state transducers.",
        "Our algorithm finds answers to questions of types 1, 2 and 3, with nearly no errors due to silence, or to noise.",
        "The few cases of remaining errors are treated in section 5 and we show, that in order to avoid them by a general method, one must perform a complete syntactic analysis of This is true whatever the size of the database is.",
        "the sentence.",
        "Our algorithm has three different applications.",
        "First, by using dictionaries of proper nouns and local grammars describing occupations, it answers requests.",
        "Synonyms and hyponyms are formally treated, as well as the chronological evolution of the corpus.",
        "By consulting a preprocessed index of the database, it provides results in real time.",
        "The second application of the algorithm consists in replacing proper nouns in FSTs by variables, and use them to locate and propose to the user new proper nouns not listed in dictionaries.",
        "In this way, the construction of the library of FSTs and of the dictionaries can be automated at least in part.",
        "The third application is automatic translation of such noun phrases, by constructing the equivalent transducers in the different languages.",
        "In section 2, we provide the formal description of the problem, and we show how we can use automaton representations.",
        "In section 3, we show how we can handle requests.",
        "In section 4, we give some examples.",
        "In section 5, we analyze failed answers.",

        "Dans le premier cas, des occurrences non triviales sont trouvees: par exemple, celles ne comportant pas de mots de la requete, mais des constructions synonymes ou meme le nom propre associe a cette profession par des occurrences precedentes.",
        "Le resultat d'une telle recherche est donc largement superieur h ce qu'on obtient par mots-clefs, ou par association statistique.",
        "Mis h. part quelques cas d'homonymies, toutes les reponses sont exactes, certaines peuvent etre imprecises.",
        "Nous avons construit pour le frangais, une telle bibliotheque de transducteurs finis, et un travail analogue est en cours pour l'anglais.",
        "D'une maniere aussi importante que le formalisme utilise, nous montrons comment l'utilisation d'une interface conviviale de construction de graphe rend possible une telle demarche.",
        "Nous montrons comment utiliser ces memes transducteurs pour completer les dictionnaires de noms propres, et donc d'avoir de meilleurs resultats.",
        "Nous montrons enfin comment de tels transducteurs peuvent etre utilises pour traduire les termes decrivant des professions."
