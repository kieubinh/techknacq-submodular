        "It is well known that a child's acquisition of phonology is gradual, and can be charted according to the appearance of phonetic distinctions (e.g. stops vs. fricatives), the disappearance of childish mispronunciations, especially due to assimilation ([gog] for dog), and the ability to articulate particular phonetic configurations (e.g. consonant clusters).",
        "Whether screening whole populations of children, or assessing individual referrals, the articulation test is an important tool for the speech clinician.",
        "A child's articulatory development is usually described with reference to an adult model, and in terms of deviations from it: a number of phonological \"processes\" can be identified, and their significance with respect to the chronological age of the child assessed.",
        "Often processes interact, e.g. when spoon is pronounced [mull] we have consonant-cluster reduction and assimilation.",
        "The problem for this paper is to align the segments in the transcription of the child's articulation with the target model pronunciation.",
        "The task is complicated by the need to identify cases of \"metathesis\", where the corresponding sounds have been reordered (e.g. remember . – [flurernba]) and \"merges\", a special case of consonant-cluster reduction where the resulting segment has some of the features of both elements in the original cluster (e.g. sleep"

        "Before we consider the algorithms themselves, however, it is appropriate to mention briefly the issue of transcription.",
        "On the one hand, children's articulations can include a much wider variety of phones than those which are found in the target system; in addition, certain secondary phonetic features may be particularly important in the description of the child's articulation (e.g. spreading, laryngealization).",
        "So the transcriptions need to be \"narrow\".",
        "On the other hand, speech clinicians nevertheless tend to use a \"contrastive\" transcription, essentially phonemic except where the child's articulation differs from the target: so normal allophonic variation will not necessarily be reflected in the transcription.",
        "Any program that is to be used for the analysis of articulation data will need an appropriate coding scheme which allows a narrow transcription in a fairly transparent notation.",
        "Some software offers phonetic transcription schemes based on the ASCII character set (e.g. Perry 1995).",
        "Alternatively, it seems quite feasible to allow the transcriptions to be input using a standard word-processor and a phonetic font, and to interpret the symbols accordingly.",
        "For a commercial implementation it would be better to follow the standard proposed by the IPA (Esling & Gaylord 1993), which has been approved by the ISO, and included in the Unicode definitions.",
        "2.2.",
        "Internal representation Representing the phonetic segments as bundles of features is an obvious technique, and one which is widely adopted.",
        "In the algorithm reported in Somers (1979) – henceforth CAT – phones are represented as bundles of binary articulatory features.",
        "Some primary features also serve as secondary features where appropriate (e.g. dark 'I' is marked as VEL(ar)), but there are also explicit secondary features, e.g. ASP(iration).",
        "Connolly (1997) suggests two alternative feature representations.",
        "The first is based on perceptual features, which, he claims, are more significant than articulatory features \"from the point of view of communicative dysfunction\" (p.276).",
        "On the other hand, he admits that using perceptual features can be problematic, unless \"we are prepared to accept a relatively unrefined quantification method\" (p.277).",
        "Connolly rejects a number of perceptual feature schemes for consonants in favour of one proposed by Line (1987), which identifies two perceptual features or axes, \"friction strength\" (FS) and \"pitch\" (P), and divides the consonant phones into six groups, differentiated by their score on each of these axes, as shown in Figure I.",
        "Henceforth we will refer to this scheme as \"FS/P\".",
        "In fact, there are a number of drawbacks and shortcomings in Connolly's scheme for our purposes, notably the absence of many non-English phones (all non-pulmonics, uvulars, retroflexes, trills and taps), and there is no indication how to handle secondary features typically needed to transcribe children's articulations accurately.",
        "We have tried to rectify the first shortcoming in our implementation, but it is not obvious how to deal with the second.",
        "Connolly's alternative feature representation is based on articulatory features, adapted from Ladefoged's (1971) system, though unlike the features used in the CAT scheme, some of the features are not binary.",

        "In the case of CAT, the distance measure is quite simply a count of the binary features for which the polarity differs.",
        "So for example, when comparing the articulation [d] with a target of [st], the [s] and [d] differ in terms of three features (VOICE, STOP and FRIC) while [t] and [d] differ in only one (VOICE): so [d] is more similar to [t] than to [s].",
        "In FS/P, the two features are weighted to reflect the greater importance of FS over P, the former being valued double the latter.",
        "To calculate the similarity of two phones we add the difference in their FS scores to half the difference in their P scores.",
        "If the two phones are in the same group, the score is set at 0.05 (unless they are identical, in which case it is 0).",
        "Thus, to take our [st]-*[d] example again, since [s] is in group 6, and [t] and [d] both in group 3, [t]-[d] scores 0.05, [s]-[d] 0.95.",
