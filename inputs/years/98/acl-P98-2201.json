        "Structural ambiguity is one of the most serious problems faced by Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.",
        "It occurs when the syntactic information does not suffice to make an assignment decision.",
        "Prepositional phrase (PP) attachment is, perhaps, the canonical case of structural ambiguity.",
        "What kind of information should we use in order to solve this ambiguity?",
        "In most cases, the information needed comes from a local context, and the attachment decision is based essentially on the relationships existing between predicates and arguments, what Katz y Fodor (1963) called selectional restrictions.",
        "For example, in the expression: (V accommodate) (NP Johnson's election) (PP as a director), the PP is attached to the NP.",
        "However, in the expression: (V taking) (NP that news) (PP as a sign to be cautious), the PP is attached to the verb.",
        "In both expressions, the attachment site is decided on the basis of verb and noun selectional restrictions.",
        "In other cases, the information determining the PP attachment comes from a global context.",
        "In this paper we will focus on the disambiguation mechanism based on selectional restrictions.",
        "Previous work has shown that it is extremely difficult to build handmade rule-based systems able to deal with this kind of problem.",
        "Since such handmade systems proved unsuccessful, in recent years two main methods have appeared capable of automatic learning from tagged corpora: automatic rule based methods and statistical methods.",
        "In this paper we will show that, providing that the problem is correctly approached, an NN can obtain better results than any of the methods used to date for PP attachment disambiguation.",
        "Statistical methods consider how a local context can disambiguate PP attachment estimating the probability from a corpus: p(verb attachjv N P1 prep N P2) Since an NP can be arbitrarily complex, the problem can be simplified by considering that only the heads of the respective phrases are relevant when deciding PP attachment.",
        "Therefore, ambiguity is resolved by means of a model that takes into account only phrasal heads: p(verb attachlverb n1 prep n2).",
        "There are two distinct methods for establishing the relationships between the verb and its arguments: methods using words (lexical preferences) and methods using semantic classes (selectional restrictions)."

        "Collins and Brooks (1995) showed how serious this problem can be: almost 95% of the 3097 4-tuples of their test set do not appear in their 20801 training set 4 tuples.",

        "In the test, attachment to verb was decided if p(preplverb) > p(prepinoun); otherwise attachment to n1 is decided.",

        "A complementary explanation for the poor results using classes would be that current methods do not use class information very effectively for several reasons: 1.-In WordNet, a particular sense belongs to several classes (a word belongs to a class if it falls within the IS-A tree below that class), and so determining an adequate level of abstraction is difficult.",
        "2.- Most words have more than one sense.",

        "(1994)'s results are the best reported so far using only classes (for 100% coverage): 79.1%.",
        "From these results we can conclude that improvements in the syntactic disambiguation problem will come not only from the availability of better hierarchies of classes but also from methods that use them better.",
        "NNs seem especially well designed to use them effectively.",
        "How do we account for the improved results?",
        "First, we used verb class information.",
        "Given the set of words in the 4-tuple and a way to repre",
        "sent senses and semantic class information, a syntactic disambiguation system (SDS) must find some regularities between the co-occurrence of classes and the attachment point.",
        "Presenting all of the classes of all the senses of the complete 4-tuple simultaneously, assuming that the training set is adequate, the network can detect which classes (and consequently which senses) are related with which others.",
        "As we have said, due to its complexity, current methods do not consider the complete 4-tuple simultaneously.",
        "For example, Li and Abe (1995) use p(verb attachlv prep n2) or p(verb attachlv n1 prep)).",
        "The task of selecting which of the senses contributes to making the correct attachment could be difficult if the whole 4 tuple is not simultaneously present.",
        "A verb has many senses, and each one could have a different argumental structure.",
        "In the selection of the correct sense of the verb, the role of the object (n1) is very important.",
        "Deciding the attachment site by computing p(verb attach Iv prep n2) would be inadequate.",
        "It is also inadequate to omit n2.",
        "Rule based approaches also come up against this problem.",
        "In Brill and Resnik (1994), for instance, for reasons of runtime efficiency and complexity, rules regarding the classes of both n1 and n2 were not permitted.",
        "Using a parallel presentation it is also possible to detect complex interactions between the classes of a particular sense (for example, exceptions) or the classes of different senses that cannot be detected in the case of current statistical methods.",
        "We have detected these interactions in studies on word sense disambiguation we are currently carrying out.",
        "For example, the behavior of verbs which have the senses of process and state differs from that of verbs which have the sense of process but not of state, and vicev-ersa.",
        "A parallel presentation (of classes as well of senses) gives rise to a highly complex input.",
        "A very important characteristic of neural networks is their capability of dealing with multidimensional inputs (Barron, 1993).",
        "They can compute very complex statistical functions and they are model free.",
        "Compared to the current methods used by the statistical or rule-based approaches to natural language processing, NNs offer the possibility of dealing with a much more complex approach (non-linear and high dimensional)."
