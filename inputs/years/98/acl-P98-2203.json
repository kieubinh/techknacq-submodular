        "The paper argues that language change can be explained through the stochasticity observed in real-world natural language use.",
        "This thesis is demonstrated by modeling language use through language games played in an evolving population of agents.",
        "We show that the artificial languages which the agents spontaneously develop based on self-organisation, do not evolve even if the population is changing.",
        "Then we introduce stochasticity in language use and show that this leads to a constant innovation (new forms and new form-meaning associations) and a maintenance of variation in the population, if the agents are tolerant to variation.",
        "Some of these variations overtake existing linguistic k conventions, particularly in changing populations, thus explaining lexicon change."

        "Natural language evolution takes place at all levels of language (McMahon, 1994).",
        "This is partly due to external factors such as language contact between different populations or the need to express new meanings or support new modes of interaction with language.",
        "But it is well-established that language also changes spontaneously based on an internal dynamics (Labov, 1994).",
        "For example, many sound changes, like from /b/ to /p/, /d/ to /t/, and /g/ to /k/, which took place in the evolution from proto-Indo-European to Modern Germanic languages, do not have an external motivation.",
        "Neither do many shifts in the expression of meanings.",
        "For example, the expression of future tense in English has shifted from \"shall\" to \"will\", even though \"shall\" was perfectly suited and \"will\" meant something else (namely \"wanting to\").",
        "Similarly, restructuring of the grammar occurs without any apparent reason.",
        "For example, in Modern English the auxiliaries come before the main verb, whereas in Old English after it ('he conquered be would' (Old English) vs. 'he would be conquered' (Modern English)).",
        "This internal, apparently nonfunctional evolution of language has been discussed widely in the linguistic literature, leading some linguists to strongly reject the possibility of evolutionary explanations of language (Chomsky, 1990).",
        "In biological systems, evolution takes place because [1] a population shows natural variation, and [2] the distribution of traits in the population changes under the influence of selection pressures present in the environment.",
        "Note that biological variation is also non-functional.",
        "Natural selection acts post factum as a selecting agent, pushing the population in certain directions, but the novelty is created independently of a particular goal by stochastic forces operating during genetic transmission and development.",
        "Our hypothesis is that the same applies to language, not at the genetic but at the cultural level.",
        "We hypothesise that language formation and evolution take place at the level of language itself, without any change in the genetic make up of the agents.",
        "Language recruits and exploits available brain capacities of the agents but does not require any capacity which is not already needed for other activities (see also (Batali, 1998), (Kirby and Hurford, 1997)).",
        "The present paper focuses on the lexicon.",
        "It proposes a model to explain spontaneous lexicon evolution, driven solely by internal factors.",
        "In order to have any explanatory force at all, we cannot put into the model the ingredients that we try to explain.",
        "Innovation, maintenance of variation, and change should follow as emergent properties of the operation of the model.",
        "Obtaining variation is not obvious, be",
        "cause a language community should also have a natural tendency towards coherence, otherwise communication would not be effective.",
        "An adequate explanatory model of lexicon change must therefore show [1] how a coherent lexicon may arise in a group of agents, [2] how nevertheless the lexicon may remain internally varied and exhibit constant innovation, and [3] how some of this variation may be amplified to become dominant in the population.",
        "These three quite difficult challenges are taken up in the next three sections of the paper.",
        "2 How a coherent lexicon may arise To investigate concretely how a lexicon may originate, be transmitted from one generation to the next, and evolve, we have developed a minimal model of language use in a dynamically evolving population, called the naming game (Steels, 1996).",
        "The naming game has been explored through computational simulations and is related to systems proposed and investigated by (Oliphant, 1996), (MacLennan, 1991), (Werner and Dyer, 1991), a.o.",
        "It has even been implemented on robotic agents who develop autonomously a shared lexicon grounded in their sensori-motor experiences (Steels and Vogt, 1997), (Steels, 1997).",
        "The naming game focuses on associating form and meaning.",
        "Obviously in human natural languages both form and meaning are non-atomic entities with complex internal structure, but the results reported here do not depend on this internal complexity.",
        "We assume a set of agents A where each agent a E A has contact with a set of objects 0 = {oo, on}.",
        "The set of objects constitutes the environment of the agents.",
        "A word is a sequence of letters randomly drawn from a finite alphabet.",
        "The agents are all assumed to share the same alphabet.",
        "A lexicon ,C is a time-dependent relation between objects, words, and a score.",
        "Each agent a E A has his own set of words Wti,t and his own lexicon La,t C Ca X Wcht X which is initially empty.",
        "An agent a is therefore defined at a time t as a pair at =< Wa,t, La,t >.",
        "There is the possibility of synonymy and homonymy: An agent can associate a single word with several objects and a given object with several words.",
        "It is not required that all agents have at all times the same set of words and the same lexicon.",
        "We assume that environmental conditions identify a context C c 0.",
        "The speaker selects one object as the topic of this context fs E C. He signals this topic using extralinguistic communication (such as through pointing).",
        "Based on the interpretation of this signalling, the hearer constructs an object score 0.0 < e, < 1.0 for each object o E C reflecting the likelihood that o is the speaker's topic.",
        "If there is absolute certainty, one object has a score of 1.0 and the others are all 0.0.",
        "If there is no extralinguistic communication, the likelihood of all objects is the same.",
        "If there is only vague extralinguistic communication, the hearer has some idea what the topic is, but with less certainty.",
        "The meaning scope parameter am determines the number of object candidates the hearer is willing to consider.",
        "The meaning focus parameter Om determines the tolerance to consider objects that are not the center of where the speaker pointed to.",
        "In the experiments reported in this paper, the object-score is determined by assuming that all objects are positioned on a 2-dimensional grid.",
        "The distance d between the topic and the other objects determines the object-score, such that",
        "Om is the meaning focus factor.",
        "To name the topic, the speaker retrieves from his lexicon all the associations which involve f3.",
        "This set is called the association-set of h. Let o E 0 be an object, a E A be an agent, and t a time moment, then the association-set of o is = {< 0, W, U >l< 0, W, U >E La.,t} (2) Each of the associations in this set suggests a word w to use for identifying o with a score 0.0 < U < 1.0.",
        "The speaker orders the words based on these scores.",
        "He then chooses the association with the largest score and transmits the word which is part of this association to the hearer.",
        "Next the hearer receives the word w transmitted by the speaker.",
        "To handle stochasticity the hearer not only considers the word itself a set of candidate words W related to w. These are all the words in the word-set of the hearer Wh,t that are either equal to w or related with some distance to w. The form scope parameter",
        "f determines how far this distance can be.",
        "A score is imposed over the members of the set of candidate words:",
        "cbj is the form-focus factor.",
        "The higher this factor, the sharper the hearer has been able to identify the word produced by the speaker, and therefore the less tolerant the hearer is going to be to accept other candidates.",
        "For each word wi in W, the hearer then retrieves the association-set that contains it.",
        "He constructs a score-matrix which contains for each object a row and for each word-form a column.",
        "The first column contains the object-scores e0, the first row the form-scores m3.",
        "Each cell in the inner-matrix contains the association-score for the relation between the object and the word-form in the lexicon of the hearer:",
        "Obviously many cells in the matrix may be empty (and then set to 0.0), because a certain relation between an object and a word-form may not be in the lexicon of the hearer.",
        "Note also that there may be objects identified by lexicon lookup which are not in the initial context C. They are added to the matrix, but their object-score is 0.0.",
        "The final state of an inner matrix cell of the score matrix is computed by taking a weighted sum of (1) the object-score e0 on its row, (2) the word-form score mw on its column, and (3) the association-score a<0,w> in the cell itself.",
        "Weights indicate how strong the agent is willing to rely on each source of information.",
        "One object-word pair will have the best score and the corresponding object is the topic fh chosen by the hearer.",
        "The association in the lexicon of this object-word pair is called the winning association.",
        "This choice integrates extralinguistic information (the object-score), word-form ambiguity (the word-form-score), and the current state of the hearer's lexicon (the association-score).",
        "The hearer then indicates to the speaker what topic he identified.",
        "In real-world language games, this could be through a subsequent action or through another linguistic interaction.",
        "When a decision could be made and fh = h the game succeeds, otherwise it fails.",
        "The following adaptations take place by the speaker and the hearer based on the outcome of the game.",
        "1.",
        "The game succeeds This means that speaker and hearer agree on the topic.",
        "To re-enforce the lexicon, the speaker increments the score u of the association that he preferred, and hence used, with a fixed quantity 6.",
        "And decrements the score of the n competing associations with 6.",
        "0.0 and 1.0 remain the lower and up-perbound of u.",
        "An association is competing if it associates the topic h with another word.",
        "The hearer increments by 6 the score of the association that came out with the best score in the score-matrix, and decrements the n competing associations with 6.",
        "An association is competing if it associates the wordform of the winning association with another meaning.",
        "2.",
        "The game fails There are several cases:",
        "It could be that the speaker failed to retrieve from the lexicon an association covering the topic.",
        "In that case, the game fails but the speaker may create a new word-form w' and associate this with the topic f, in his lexicon.",
        "This happens with a word creation probability wa.",
        "In other words there is no association in the lexicon of the hearer involving the word-form of the winning association.",
        "In that case, the game ends in failure but the hearer may extend his lexicon with a word absorption probability wa.",
        "He associates the word-form with the highest form-score to the object with the highest object-score.",
        "3.",
        "There is a mismatch between fh and h.",
        "In this case, both speaker and hearer have to adapt their lexicons.",
        "The speaker and the hearer decrement with 6 the association that they used.",
        "Figure 1 shows that the model achieves our first objective.",
        "It displays the results of an experiment where in phase 1 a group of 20 agents develops from scratch a shared lexicon for naming 10 objects.",
        "Average game success reaches",
        "20 agents and 10 meanings how a coherent set of form-meaning pairs emerges (phase 1).",
        "In a second phase, an in and outflow of agents (1 in/outflow per 200 games) is introduced, the language stays the same and high success and coherence is maintained.",
        "a maximum and lexicon coherence (measured as the average spread in the population of the most dominant form-meaning pairs) is high (100 %) In the early stage there is important lexicon change as new form-meaning pairs need to be generated from scratch by the agents.",
        "Lexicon change is defined to take place when a new form-meaning pair overtakes another one in the competition for the same meaning.",
        "Phase 2 demonstrates that the lexicon is resilient to a flux in the population.",
        "An in and outflow of agents is introduced.",
        "A new agent coming into the population has no knowledge at all about the existing set of conventions.",
        "Success and coherence therefore dip but quickly regain as the new agents acquire the existing lexicon.",
        "High coherence is maintained as well as high average game success.",
        "Between the beginning of the flux and the end (after 30,000 language games), the population has been renewed 5 times.",
