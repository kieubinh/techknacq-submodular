        "I propose a model for determining the hearer's attentional state in understanding discourse.",
        "My proposal is inspired by the centering model (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995) and draws on the conclusions of Strube & Hahn's (1996) approach for the ranking of the forward-looking center list for German.",
        "Their approach has been proven as the point of departure for a new model which is valid for English as well.",
        "The use of the centering transitions in Brennan et al.'s (1987) algorithm prevents it from being applied incrementally (cf. Kehler (1997)).",
        "In my approach, I propose to replace the functions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions by the order among the elements of the list of salient discourse entities (S-list).",
        "The S-list ranking criteria define a preference for hearer-old over hearer-new discourse entities (Prince, 1981) generalizing Strube & Hahn's (1996) approach.",
        "Because of these ranking criteria, I can account for the difference in salience between definite NPs (mostly hearer-old) and indefinite NPs (mostly hearer-new).",
        "The S-list is not a local data structure associated with individual utterances.",
        "The S-list rather describes the attentional state of the hearer at any given point in processing a discourse.",
        "The S-list is generated incrementally, word by word, and used immediately.",
        "Therefore, the S-list integrates in the simplest manner preferences for inter and intra-sentential anaphora, making further specifications for processing complex sentences unnecessary.",
        "Section 2 describes the centering model as the relevant background for my proposal.",
        "In Section 3, I introduce my model, its only data structure, the S-list, and the accompanying algorithm.",
        "In Section 4, I compare the results of my algorithm with the results of the centering algorithm (Brennan et al., 1987) with and without specifications for complex sentences (Kameyama, 1998)."
