        "Information retrieval (IR) is a task of selecting documents from a database in response to a user's query, and ranking them according to relevance.",
        "This has been usually accomplished using statistical methods (often coupled with manual encoding) that (a) select terms (words, phrases, and other units) from documents that are deemed to best represent their content, and (b) create an inverted index file (or files) that provide an easy access to documents containing these terms.",
        "A subsequent search process attempts to match preprocessed user queries against term-based representations of documents in each case determining a degree of relevance between the two which depends upon the number and types of matching terms.",
        "A search is successful if it can return as many as possible documents which are relevant to the query, with as few as possible non-relevant documents.",
        "In addition, the relevant documents should be ranked ahead of non-relevant ones.",
        "The quantitative text representation methods, predominant in today's leading information retrieval systemsi limit 'Representations anchored on words, word or char-the system's ability to generate a successful search because they rely more on the form of a query than on its content in finding document matches.",
        "This problem is particularly acute in ad-hoc retrieval situations where the user has only a limited knowledge of database composition and needs to resort to generic or otherwise incomplete search statements.",
        "In order to overcome this limitation, many IR systems allow varying degrees of user interaction that facilitates query optimization and calibration to closer match user's information seeking goals.",
        "A popular technique here is relevance feedback, where the user or the system judges the relevance of a sample of results returned from an initial search, and the query is subsequently rebuilt to reflect this information.",
        "Automatic relevance feedback techniques can lead to a very close mapping of known relevant documents, however, they also tend to overfit, which in turn reduces their ability of finding new documents on the same subject.",
        "Therefore, a serious challenge for information retrieval is to devise methods for building better queries, or in assisting user to do so."

        "We have been experimenting with manual and automatic natural language query (or topic, in TREC parlance) building techniques.",
        "This differs from most query modification techniques used in IR in that our method is to reformulate the user's statement of information need rather than the search system's internal representation of it, as relevance feedback does.",
        "Our goal is to devise a method of full-text expansion that would allow for creating exhaustive search topics such that: (1) the performance of any system using the expanded topics would be significantly better than when the system is run using the original topics, and (2) the method of topic atter sequences, or some surrogates of these, along with significance weights derived from their distribution in the database.",
        "expansion could eventually be automated or semiautomated so as to be useful to a non-expert user.",
        "Note that the first of the above requirements effectively calls for a free text, unstructured, but highly precise and exhaustive description of user's search statement.",
        "The preliminary results from TREC evaluations show that such an approach is indeed very effective.",
        "One way to view query expansion is to make the user query resemble more closely the documents it is expected to retrieve.",
        "This may include both content, as well as some other aspects such as composition, style, language type, etc.",
        "If the query is indeed made to resemble a \"typical\" relevant document, then suddenly everything about this query becomes a valid search criterion: words, collocations, phrases, various relationships, etc.",
        "Unfortunately, an average search query does not look anything like this, most of the time.",
        "It is more likely to be a statement specifying the semantic criteria of relevance.",
        "This means that except for the semantic or conceptual resemblance (which we cannot model very well as yet) much of the appearance of the query (which we can model reasonably well) may be, and often is, quite misleading for search purposes.",
        "Where can we get the right queries?",
        "In today's information retrieval, query expansion usually is typically limited to adding, deleting or re-weighting of terms.",
        "For example, content terms from documents judged relevant are added to the query while weights of all terms are adjusted in order to reflect the relevance information.",
        "Thus, terms occurring predominantly in relevant documents will have their weights increased, while those occurring mostly in non-relevant documents will have their weights decreased.",
        "This process can be performed automatically using a relevance feedback method, e.g., (Rocchio 1971), with the relevance information either supplied manually by the user (Harman 1988), or otherwise guessed, e.g. by assuming top 10 documents relevant, etc.",
        "(Buckley, et al.",
        "1995).",
        "A serious problem with this term-based expansion is its limited ability to capture and represent many important aspects of what makes some documents relevant to the query, including particular term co-occurrence patterns, and other hard-to-measure text features, such as discourse structure or stylistics.",
        "Additionally, relevance-feedback expansion depends on the inherently partial relevance information, which is normally unavailable, or unreliable.",
        "Other types of query expansions, including general purpose thesauri or lexical databases (e.g., Wordnet) have been found generally unsuccessful in information retrieval, (Voorhees 1994).",
        "An alternative to term-only expansion is a full-text expansion described in (Strzalkowski et al.",
        "1997).",
        "In this approach, search topics are expanded by pasting in entire sentences, paragraphs, and other sequences directly from any text document.",
        "To make this process efficient, an initial search is performed with the unexpanded queries and the top N (10-30) returned documents are used for query expansion.",
        "These documents, irrespective of their overall relevancy to the search topic, are scanned for passages containing concepts referred to in the query.",
        "The resulting expanded queries undergo further text processing steps, before the search is run again.",
        "We need to note that the expansion material was found in both relevant and non-relevant documents, benefiting the final query all the same.",
        "In fact, the presence of such text in otherwise non-relevant documents underscores the inherent limitations of distribution-based term reweighting used in relevance feedback.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method of full-text topic expansion where the expansion passages are obtained from an automatic text summarizer.",
        "A preliminary examination of TREC-6 results indicate that this mode of expansion is at least as effective as the purely manual expansion which requires the users to read entire documents to select expansion passages.",
        "This brings us a step closer to a fully automated expansion: the human-decision factor has been reduced to an accept/reject decision for expanding the search query with a summary."

        "The expanded query runs are contrasted with runs obtained using TREC original topics using NLIR as well as Cornell's SMART (version 11) which serves here as a benchmark.",
        "The first two columns are automatic runs, which means that there was no human intervention in the process at any time.",
        "Since query expansion requires human decision on summary selection, these runs (columns 3 and 4) are classified as \"manual\", although most of the process is automatic.",
        "As can be seen, query expansion produces an impressive improvement in precision at all levels.",
        "Recall figures are shown at 1000 retrieved documents.",
        "Query expansion appears to produce consistently high gains not only for different sets of queries but",
        "also for different systems: we asked other groups participating in TREC to run search using our expanded queries, and they reported similarly large improvements.",
        "Finally, we may note that NLP-based indexing has also a positive effect on overall performance, but the improvements are relatively modest, particularly on the expanded queries.",
        "A similar effect of reduced effectiveness of linguistic indexing has been reported also in connection with improved term weighting techniques."

        "We have developed a method to derive quick-read summaries from news-like texts using a number of shallow NLP and simple quantitative techniques.",
        "The summary is assembled out of passages extracted from the original text, based on a predetermined DMS template.",
        "This approach has produced a very efficient and robust summarizer for news-like texts.",
        "We used the summarizer, via the QET interface, to build effective search queries for an information retrieval system.",
        "This has been demonstrated to produce dramatic performance improvements in TREC evaluations.",
        "We believe that this query expansion approach will also prove useful in searching very large databases where obtaining a full index may be impractical or impossible, and accurate sampling will become critical.",
