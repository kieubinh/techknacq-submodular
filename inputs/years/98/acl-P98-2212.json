        "In addition to words, such lexicons involve syntactic and semantic descriptions and means to perform a correct transfer between the two sides of a bilingual lexical entry.",
        "A symbolic, rule-based approach of the parse-parse-match kind is proposed.",
        "The core idea is to use the resources of bidirectional transfer MT systems for this purpose, taking advantage of their features to convert them to a novel use.",
        "In addition to having them use their bilingual lexicons to produce translations, it is proposed to have them use translations to produce bilingual lexicons.",
        "Although other uses might be conceived, the most appropriate use is to have an MT system automatically augment its own bilingual lexicon from a small initial sample.",
        "The core of the described approach consists of using a set of bilingual lexical templates in matching the parses of two aligned sentences and in turning the lexical equivalences thus established into new bilingual lexical entries."

        "The basic requirement that an MT system should meet for the present purpose is to be bidirectional.",
        "Bidirectionality is required in order to ensure that both source and target grammars can be used for parsing and that transfer can be done in both directions.",
        "More precisely, what is relevant is that the input and output to transfer be the same kind of structure.",
        "Moreover, the proposed method is most productive with a lexicalist MT system (White-lock, 1994).",
        "The proposed application is concerned with producing bilingual lexical knowledge and this sort of knowledge is the only type of bilingual knowledge required by lexicalist systems.",
        "Nevertheless, it is also conceivable that the present approach can be used with a non-lexicalist transfer system, as long as the system is bidirectional.",
        "In this case, only the lexical portion of the bilingual knowledge can be automatically produced, assuming that the structural transfer portion is already in place.",
        "In the rest of this paper, a lexicalist MT system will be assumed and referred to.",
        "For the specific implementation described here and all the examples, we will refer to an existing lexicalist English-Spanish MT system (Popowich et al., 1997).",
        "The main feature of a lexicalist MT system is that it performs no structural transfer.",
        "Transfer is a mapping between a bag of lexical items used in parsing (the source bag) and a corresponding bag of target lexical items (the target bag), to be used in generation.",
        "The source bag actually contains more information than the corresponding bag of lexical items before parsing.",
        "Its elements get enriched with additional information instantiated during the parsing process.",
        "Information of fundamental importance included therein is a system of indices that express de",
        "pendencies among lexical items.",
        "Such dependencies are transferred to the target bag and used to constrain generation.",
        "The task of generation is to find an order in which the lexical items can be successfully parsed."

      "heading": "3 Bilingual templates",
      "text": [
        "A bilingual template is a bilingual entry in which words are left unspecified.",
        "E.g.:",
        "Here, a :' operator connects a word (a variable, in a template) to a description, connects the left and right sides of the entry, 'W introduces a transfer macro, which takes two descriptions as arguments and performs some additional transfer (Turcato et al., 1997).",
        "Descriptions are mainly expressed by macros, introduced by a `0' operator.",
        "The macro arguments are indices, as used in lexicalist transfer.",
        "Templates have been widely used in MT (Buschbeck-Wolf and Dorna, 1997), particularly in the Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) framework (Kaji et al.",
        "(1992), Giivenir and Tunc (1996)).",
        "However, in EBMT, templates are most often used to model sentence-level correspondences, rather then lexical equivalences.",
        "Consequently, in EBMT the relation between lexical equivalences and templates is the reverse of what is being proposed here.",
        "In EBMT, lexical equivalences are assumed and (sentential) templates are inferred from them.",
        "In the present framework, sentential correspondences (in the form of possible combinations of lexical templates) are assumed and lexical equivalences are inferred from them.",
        "In a lexicalist approach, the notion of bilingual lexical entry, and thus that of bilingual template, must be intended broadly.",
        "Multiword entries can exist.",
        "They can express dependencies among lexical items, thus being suitable for expressing phrasal equivalences.",
        "In brief, bilingual lexical entries can exhaustively cover all the bilingual information needed in transfer.",
        "In a lexicalist MT system, transfer is accomplished by finding a bag of bilingual entries partitioning the source bag.",
        "The source side of each entry (in the rest of this paper: the left hand side) corresponds to a cell of the partition.",
        "The",
        "union of the target sides of the entries constitutes the target bag.",
        "E.g.: (2) a.",
        "Source bag:",
        "where each Swi::Sdi and Twi::Tdi are, respectively, a source and target < Word,Description> pair.",
        "In addition, the bilingual entries must satisfy the constraints expressed by indices in the source and target bags.",
        "The same information can be used to find (2b), given (2a) and (2c).",
        "Any bilingual lexicon is partitioned by a set of templates.",
        "The entries in each equivalence class only differ by their words.",
        "A bilingual lexical entry can thus be viewed as a triple <Sw,Tw,T>, where Sw is a list of source words, Tw a list of target words, and T a template.",
        "A set of such bilingual templates can be intuitively regarded as a 'transfer grammar'.",
        "A grammar defines all the possible sequences of pre-terminal symbols, i.e. all the possible types of sentences.",
        "Analogously, a set of bilingual templates defines all the possible translational equivalences between bags of pre-terminal symbols, i.e. all the possible equivalences between types of sentences.",
        "Using this intuition, the possibility is explored of analyzing a pair of such bags by means of a database of bilingual templates, to find a bag of templates that correctly accounts for the translational equivalence of the two bags, without resorting to any information about words.",
        "In the example (2), the following bag of templates would be the requested solution:",
        "Equivalences between (bags of) words are automatically obtained as a result of the process, whereas in translating they are assumed and used to select the appropriate bilingual entries.",
        "The whole idea is based on the assumption that a lexical item's description and the constraints on its indices are sufficient in most cases to uniquely identify a lexical item in a parse output bag.",
        "Although exceptions could be found (most notably, two modifiers of the same category modifying the same head), the idea is viable enough to be worth exploring.",
        "The impression might arise that it is difficult and impractical to have a set of templates available in advance.",
        "However, there is empirical evidence to the contrary.",
        "A count on the MT system used here showed that a restricted number of templates covers a large portion of a bilingual lexicon.",
        "Table 1 shows the incremental coverage.",
        "Although completeness is hard to obtain, a satisfactory coverage can be achieved with a relatively small number of templates.",
        "In the implementation described here, a set of templates was extracted from the MT bilingual lexicon and used to bootstrap further lexical development.",
        "The whole lexical development can be seen as an interactive process involving a bilingual lexicon and a template database.",
        "Templates are initially derived from the lexicon, new entries are successively created using the templates.",
        "Iteratively, new entries can be manually coded when the automatic procedure is lacking appropriate templates and new templates extracted from the manually coded entries can be added to the template database."

        "Secondly, as the bilingual template database grows, the chance of overlaps between templates also grows.",
        "Two different templates or combinations of templates might cover the same input and output.",
        "A case in point is that of a phrasal verb or an idiom covered by both a single multi-word template and a compositional combination of simpler templates.",
        "As both potential sources of error can be automatically detected, a first step in tackling the problem would be to block the automatic generation of the entries involved when a problematic case occurs, or to have a user select the correct candidate.",
        "In this way the correctness of the output is guaranteed.",
        "The possible cost is a lack of completeness, when no user intervention is foreseen.",
        "Furthermore, techniques for the automatic resolution of template overlaps are under investigation.",
        "Such techniques assume the presence of a bilingual lexicon.",
        "The information contained therein is used to assign preferences to competing candidate entries, in two ways.",
        "Firstly, templates are probabilistically ranked, using the existing bilingual lexicon to estimate probabilities.",
        "When the choice is between single entries, the ranking can be performed by counting the frequency of each competing template in the lexicon.",
        "The entry with the most frequent template is chosen.",
        "Secondly, heuristics are used to assign preferences, based on the presence of preexisting entries related in some way to the candidate entries.",
        "This technique is suited for resolving ambiguities where multiple entries are involved.",
        "For instance, given the equivalence between 'kick the bucket' and estirar la pata' , and the competing candidates (8) a.",
        "{kick & bucket 4-* estirar & pata} b.",
        "{kick 4-* estirar, , bucket pata} the presence of an entry 'bucket 4-* balde' in the bilingual lexicon might be a clue for preferring the idiomatic interpretation.",
        "Conversely, if the hypothetical entry 'bucket 4-* pata' were already in the lexicon, the compositional interpretation might be preferred.",
        "Finally, efficiency is also dependant on the restrictiveness of grammars.",
        "The more grammars overgenerate, the more the combinatoric indeterminacy in the matching process increases.",
        "However, overgeneration is as much a problem for translation as for bilingual generation.",

        "The parse-parse-match approach to automatically building bilingual lexicons in not novel.",
        "Proposals have been put forward, e.g., by Sadler and Vendelmans (1990) and Kaji et al.",
        "(1992).",
        "Wu (1995) points out some possible difficulties of the parse-parse-match approach.",
        "Among them, the facts that \"appropriate, robust, monolingual grammars may not be available\" and \"the grammars may be incompatible across languages\" (Wu, 1995, 355).",
        "More generally, in bilingual lexicon development there is a tendency to minimize the need for linguistic resources specifically developed for the purpose.",
        "In this view, several proposals tend to use statistical, knowledge-free methods, possibly in combination with the use of existing Machine Readable Dictionaries (see, e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann (1995), which also contains a survey of related proposals, pages 195-196).",
        "The present proposal tackles the problem from a different and novel perspective.",
        "The acknowledgment that MT is the main application domain to which bilingual resources are relevant is taken as a starting point.",
        "The existence of an MT system, for which the bilingual lexicon is intended, is explicitly assumed.",
        "The potential problems due to the need for linguistic resources are bypassed by having the necessary resources available in the MT system.",
        "Rather than doing away with linguistic knowledge, the preexisting resources of the pursued application are utilized.",
        "An approach like the present can be most effectively adopted to develop tools allowing MT systems to automatically build their own bilingual lexicons.",
        "A tool of this sort would use no extra resources in addition to those already available in the MT system itself.",
        "Such a tool would take a small sample of a bilingual lexicon and use it to bootstrap the automatic development of a large lexicon.",
        "It is worth noting that the bilingual pairs thus produced would be complete bilingual entries that could be directly incorporated in the MT system, with no post-editing or addition of information.",
        "The only requirement placed by the present approach on MT systems is that they be bidirectional.",
        "Therefore, although aimed at the development of specific applications for specific MT systems, the approach is general enough to apply to a wide range of MT systems."

        "La algoritmo por krej novajn dulingvajn leksikerojn konsistas el kvin pagoj: (i – E) Fonta kaj cela frazoj estas analizataj.",
        "Fontanal-iza kaj celanaliza plur'aroj rezultas el la procezo; (iii) Transiro el la fontanaliza plur'aro estas plenumata, uzante dulingvan leksikon por fermklasaj vortoj kaj dulingvan gablonaron por malfermklasaj vortoj.",
        "La rezulto estas transira celplur'aro; (iv) La transira celplur'aro kaj la celanaliza plur'aro estas kongruigataj.",
        "Sukcesa unuigo sekvigas ke la dulingvaj eroj uzitaj en la transiro korekte jetas la fontan frazon al la cela frazo.",
        "Sekve, la dulingvajn ekvivalentojn, rezultantajn el ekzempligo de gablonoj, oni ra-jtas aserti kiel novajn dulingvajn leksikerojn; (v) Novaj dulingvaj leksikeroj estas kunmetataj el triopoj de fontaj vortlistoj, celaj vortlistoj kaj dulingvaj gablonoj.",
        "Se dulingva leksiko estas uzata ankaii por malfermklasaj vortoj, disponeblaj dulingvaj leksikeroj estas uzataj anstatail gablonoj, kiam eble.",
        "Tiamaniere, nur mankantaj dulingvaj leksikeroj estas kreataj.",
        "La algoritmo povus erari kiam du unuoj en la sama plur'aro havas unuigeblajn priskribojn, tial ebligante malkorektan kongruon.",
        "Krome, ju ph gablonaro pligrandigas, des pli pligrandigas ambigueco en kongruigo, pro interkovrigo de gablonoj.",
        "Ambailspecaj ambiguajoj tamen estas automate rimarkeblaj.",
        "Krome, probablismaj kaj heiiristikaj teknikoj por ataki la duan problemon estas eksplorataj.",
        "Per la montrita metodo, komputilaj traduksistemoj eblas ekfunkciigi aUtomatan evoluigon de dulingvaj leksikoj per malgranda komenca leksiko, sen necesi uzi pliajn rimedojn krom tiuj jam disponeblaj en la sistemo mem."
