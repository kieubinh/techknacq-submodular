        "The vast quantity of information available today makes it difficult to search for and understand the information that we want.",
        "If there are many related documents about a topic, it is important to capture their relationships so that we can obtain a clearer overview.",
        "However, most information resources, including newspaper articles do not have explicit relationships.",
        "For example, although documents on the Web are connected by hyperlinks, relationships cannot be specified.",
        "Webcasting (\"push\") applications such as Point-cast 1 constitute a promising solution to the problem of information overloading, but the articles they provide do not have links, or else must be manually linked at a high cost in terms of time and effort.",
        "This paper describes methods for relating newspaper articles automatically, and its application for a Webcasting application.",
        "A set of article on a par-'http://www.pointcast.com ticular topic is ordered chronologically, and the results are represented as a directed graph.",
        "There are various ways of relating documents and visualizing their structure.",
        "For example, USENET articles can be accessed by means of newsreader software.",
        "In the system, a label (title) is attached to each posted message, specifying whether it deals with a new topic or is a reply to a previous message.",
        "A chain of articles on a topic is called a thread.",
        "In this case, the relationships between the articles are explicitly defined.",
        "This post/reply-based approach makes it possible for a reader to group all the messages on a particular topic.",
        "However, it is difficult to capture the story of the thread from its thread structure, since appropriate titles are not added to the messages.",
        "This paper aims to provide ways of relating multiple news articles and representing their structure in a way that is easy to understand and computationally inexpensive.",
        "A set of relationships is defined here as a directed graph.",
        "A node indicates an article, and an arc from node X to Y indicates that the article X is followed by Y (or that X is adjacent to Y).",
        "An article contains both known and unknown (new) information.",
        "Known information consists of words shared by the beginning and ending points of an arc.",
        "When node X is adjacent to Y, the words are represented by (X fl Y).",

        "Even if an article follows another one, it generally contains some new information.",
        "This information can be represented by subtraction (Y – X) (Damashek, 1995), and is called differentia words, by analogy with definition sentences in dictionaries, which contain genus words and differentia.",
        "In this paper, genus and differentiae words are used to calculate the similarities between two articles, and to visualize topics in a set of articles.",

        "An efficient algorithm for finding such paths is described, later in the paper.",
        "Application of the threading method to documents on the Web would be very useful because, although such documents are connected by hyperlinks, their relationships cannot be specified.",
