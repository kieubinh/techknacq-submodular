        "More specifically, we propose a novel method for learning a probability model of subcategorization preference of verbs.",

        "dependent of other cases.",
        "When considering 2), we have to decide which superordinate class generates each observed leaf class in the verb-noun collocation.",
        "So far, there exist several works which worked on these two issues in learning col-locational knowledge of verbs and also evaluated the results in terms of syntactic disambiguation.",

        "Compared with these previous works, this paper proposes to consider the above two issues in a uniform way.",
        "First, we introduce a model of generating a collocation of a verb and argument/adjunct nouns (section 2) and then view the model as a probability model (section 3).",
        "As a model learning method, we adopt the maximum entropy model learning method (Della Pietra et al., 1997; Berger et al., 1996).",
        "Case dependencies and noun class generalization are represented as features in the maximum entropy approach.",
        "Features are allowed to have overlap and this is quite advantageous when we consider case dependencies and noun class generalization in parameter estimation.",

        "As the model evaluation criterion during the model search from general to specific ones, we employ the description length of the model and guide the search process so as to minimize the description length (Ris-sanen, 1984).",

        "Table 1 shows the performance of subcategorization preference test described in section 4.2.2, for the approximately optimal models selected by the procedure in section 4.4 (the \"Optimal\" model of \"General-to-Specific\" method), as well as for several other models including baseline models.",
        "Coverage is the rate of test instances which satisfy the case covering constraint of section 4.1.",
        "Accuracy is measured with the following heuristics: i) verb-noun collocations which satisfy the",
        "case covering constraint are preferred, ii) even those verb-noun collocations which do not satisfy the case covering constraint are assigned the conditional probabilities in (15) by neglecting cases which are not covered by the model.",
        "With these heuristics, subcategorization preference can be judged for all the test instances, and test set coverage becomes 100%.",
        "In Table 1, the \"Initial\" model is the one constructed according to the description in section 4.1, in which cases are independent of each other and the sense restriction of each case is (one of) the most general class(es).",
        "The \"Independent Cases\" model is the one obtained by removing all the case dependencies from the \"Optimal\" model, while the \"General Classes\" model is the one obtained by generalizing all the sense restriction of the \"Optimal\" model to the most general classes.",
        "The \"MDL\" model is the one with the minimum description length.",
        "This is for evaluating the effect of the MDL principle in the task of subcategorization preference model learning.",
        "The \"Optimal\" model of \"One-by-one Feature Adding\" method is the one selected from the sequence of one-by-one feature adding in section 3.1 by the procedure in section 4.4.",
        "The \"Optimal\" model of 'General-to-Specific\" method performs best among all the models in Table 1.",
        "Especially, it outperforms the \"Optimal\" model of \"One-by-one Feature Adding\" method both in coverage and accuracy.",
        "As for the size of the optimal model, the average number of the active feature set is 126 for \"Generalto-Specific\" method and 800 for \"One-by-one Feature Adding\" method.",
        "Therefore, general-to-specific feature selection algorithm achieves significant improvements over the one-by-one feature adding algorithm with much smaller number of active features.",
        "The \"Optimal\" model of \"General-to-Specific\" method outperforms both the \"Independent Cases\" and \"General Classes\" models, and thus both of the case dependencies and specific sense restriction selected by the proposed method have much contribution to improving the performance in subcategorization preference test.",
        "The \"MDL\" model performs worse than the \"Optimal\" model, because the features of the \"MDL\" model have much more specific sense restriction than those of the \"Optimal\" model, and the coverage of the \"MDL\" model is much lower than that of the \"Optimal\" model."

        "This paper proposed a novel method for learning probability models of subcategorization preference of verbs.",
        "Especially, we proposed a new model selection algorithm which starts from the most general model and gradually examines more specific models.",
        "In the experimental evaluation, it is shown that both of the case dependencies and specific sense restriction selected by the proposed method contribute to improving the performance in subcategorization preference resolution.",
        "As for future works, it is important to evaluate the performance of the learned subcategorization preference model in the real parsing task."
