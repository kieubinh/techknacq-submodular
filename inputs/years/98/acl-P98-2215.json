        "Processing spatially-based expressions in a multilingual environment is a difficult problem as these lexemes exhibit a high degree of polysemy (in particular for prepositions) and of language gaps (i.e., when there is not a one-to-one mapping between languages, whatever the linguistic level; lexical, semantic, syntactic, etc).",
        "Therefore, processing these expressions or words in a multilingual environment minimally involves having a solution for treating: (a) syntactic divergences, swim across – > traverser a la nage in French (cross ... swimming); (b) semantic mismatches, river translates into fleuve, riviêre in French; and (c), cases which lie in between clear-cut cases of language gaps (stand 4 se tenir debout/se tenir, lie 4 se tenir allonge/se tenir).",

        "The former is shared by all dictionaries, whereas the latter can be organised as a truly multilingual hierarchy.",
        "In that respect, this work differs from (Han et al., 1996) in that I do not suggest an ontology per language, but argue on the contrary for one semantic hierarchy shared by all dictionaries.'",
        "Other works which have dealt with mismatches, e.g., (Dorr and Voss, 1998) with their interlingua and knowledge representations, (Serasset, 1994) with his \"interlingua ac-ceptations\" , or (Kameyama, et al., 1991) with their infons, cannot account for cases which lie in between clear-cut cases of divergences and mismatches such as the example \"se tenir\" discussed in this paper.",
        "I have shown that enabling lexicon entries to be typed as either lexically vague or underspecified, or linked via LRs, allows us to account for the variations of word meanings in different discourse contexts.",
        "Most of the works in computational lexical semantics have dealt with either underspecification or LRs, trying to favour one representation over the other.",

        "ment of lexical semantic vagueness.",
        "In discourse approaches and formal semantics, the use of underspecification in terms of truth values led researchers, when applying their research to individual words, to the \"disjunction fallacy problem\", where a person who went to the bank, ended up going to the (financial-institution OR river-shore), whatever this object might be!, instead of a) going to the financial-institution OR b) going to the river-shore.",
        "In this paper, I have presented the usefulness of each representation, depending on the phenomenon covered.",
        "I showed the need to consider underspecification for polysemous items only, leaving homonyms to be related via their lexical forms only (and not their semantics).",
        "I believe that LRs have room for polysemous lexemes such as the lamb example, as here again one could not possibly imagine an animal being (food-OR-animal) in the same discourse context.7 Finally, lexical vagueness enables a system to process lexical items from a multilingual viewpoint, when a lexeme becomes ambiguous with respect to another language.",
        "From a multingual perspective, there is no need to address the \"sororites paradox\" (Williamson, 1994), which tries to put a clear-cut between values of the same word (e.g., not tall ... tall).",
        "It is important to note that WYSINNWYG accepts redundancy in the lexicon representations: lexemes can be both vague and underspecified or either one.",
        "One could object that the WYSINNWYG approach is knowledge intensive and puts the burden on the lexicon, as it requires one to build several type hierarchies: a STH shared by all languages and a LTH per language which inherits from the MLTH.",
        "However, the advantages of the WYSINNWYG approach are many.",
        "First, by using the MLTH, acquisition costs can be minimised, as a lot of information can be inherited by lexicons of family-related languages.",
        "This multilingual approach has been successfully applied to phonology by (Cahill and Gazdar, 1995).",
        "Second, the task of determining the meaning of words requires human intervention, and thus involves some subjectivity.",
        "WYSINNWYG presents a good way of \"reconciling\" different lexi-cographers' viewpoints by allowing a lexical processor to specialise or generalise meanings on needed basis.",
        "As such, whether a lexicographer decides to sense-tag \"en\" as Location or creates the sub-senses \"en 1\" and \"en2\" remains a virtual difference for the NLP system.",
        "Finally, and most important, WYSINNWYG presents a typing environment which accounts for the flexibility of word meanings in context, thus allowing lexicon acquirers to map words to their \"closest\" core meaning within STH (e.g., \"se",
        "tenir\" PositionState) and use mechanisms (such as generalisation, specialisation) to modulate their meanings in context (e.g., \"se tenir\" PsVertical).",
        "In other words, WYSINNWYG helps not only in sense selection but also in sense modulation.",
        "Further research involves investigating representation formalisms, as discussed in (Briscoe et al., 1993) to best implement these type inheritance hierarchies."
