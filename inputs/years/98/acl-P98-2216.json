        "Syntagmatic relations, also known as collocations, are used differently by lexicographers, linguists and statisticians denoting almost similar but not identical classes of expressions.",
        "The traditional approach to collocations has been lexicographic.",
        "Here dictionaries provide information about what is unpredictable or idiosyncratic.",
        "Benson (1989) synthesizes Hausmann's studies on collocations, calling expressions such as commit murder, compile a dictionary, inflict a wound, etc.",
        "\"fixed combinations, recurrent combinations\" or \"collocations\".",
        "In Hausmann's terms (1979) a collocation is composed of two elements, a base (\"Basis\") and a collocate (\"Kollokator\" ); the base is semantically autonomous whereas the collocate cannot be semantically interpreted in isolation.",
        "In other words, the set of lexical collocates which can combine with a given basis is not predictable and therefore collocations must be listed in dictionaries.",
        "It is hard to say that there has been a real focus on collocations from a linguistic perspective.",
        "The lexicon has been broadly sacrificed by both English-speaking schools and continental European schools.",
        "The scientific agenda of the former has been largely dominated by syntactic issues until recently, whereas the latter was more concerned with pragmatic aspects of natural languages.",
        "The focus has been on grammatical collocations such as adapt to, aim at, look for.",
        "Lakoff (1970) distinguishes a class of expressions which cannot undergo certain operations, such as nominalization, causativization: the problem is hard; *the hardness of the problem; *the problem hardened.",
        "The restriction on the application of certain syntactic operations can help define collocations such as hard problem, for example.",
        "Mel'euk's treatment of collocations will be detailed below.",
        "In recent years, there has been a resurgence of statistical approaches applied to the study of natural languages.",
        "Sinclair (1991) states that \"a word",
        "which occurs in close proximity to a word under investigation is called a collocate of it.",
        "... Collocation is the occurrence of two or more words within a short space of each other in a text\".",
        "The problem is that with such a definition of collocations, even when improved,2 one identifies not only collocations but free-combining pairs frequently appearing together such as lawyer-client; doctor-hospital.",
        "However, nowadays, researchers seem to agree that combining statistic with symbolic approaches lead to quantifiable improvements (Klavans and Resnik, 1996).",
        "The Meaning Text Theory Approach The Meaning Text Theory (MTT) is a generator-oriented lexical grammatical formalism.",
        "Lexical knowledge is encoded in an entry of the Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary (ECD), each entry being divided into three zones: the semantic zone (a semantic network representing the meaning of the entry in terms of more primitive words), the syntactic zone (the grammatical properties of the entry) and the lexical combinatorics zone (containing the values of the Lexical Functions (LFs) 3).",
        "LFs are central to the study of collocations: A lexical function F is a correspondence which associates a lexical item L, called the key word of F, with a set of lexical items F(L)-the value of F. (Mel'euk, 1988)4 We focus here on syntagmatic LFs describing co-occurrence relations such as pay attention, legitimate complaint; from a distance.5 Heylen et al.",

        "It seems nevertheless that all",
