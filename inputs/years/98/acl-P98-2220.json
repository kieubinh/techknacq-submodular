        "In the context of multilingual natural language processing systems which aim for coverage of both languages using a roman alphabet and languages using other alphabets, the development of lexical resources must include mechanisms for handling words which do not have standard translations.",
        "Words falling into this category are words which do not have any obvious semantic content, e.g. most indo-european personal and place names, and which can therefore not simply be mapped to translation equivalents.",
        "In this paper, we examine the problem of generating Chinese characters which correspond to English personal and place names.",
        "Section 2 introduces the basic principles of English-Chinese transliteration, Section 3 identifies issues specific to the domain of name transliteration, and Section 4 introduces a rule-based algorithm for automatically performing the name transliteration.",
        "In Section 5 we present an example of the application of the algorithm, and in Section 6 we discuss extensions to improve the robustness of the algorithm.",
        "Our need for automatic transliteration mechanisms stems from a multilingual text generation system which we are currently constructing, on the basis of an English-language database containing descriptive information about museum objects (the POWER system; Verspoor et al. 1998).",
        "That database includes fields such as manufacturer, with values of personal and place names.",
        "Place names and personal names do not fall into a well-defined set, nor do they have semantic content which can be expressed in other languages through words equivalent in meaning.",
        "As more objects are added to our database (as will happen as a museum acquires new objects), new names will be introduced, and these must also be added to the lexica for each language in the system.",
        "We require an automatic procedure for achieving this, and concentrate here on techniques for the creation of a Chinese lexicon."

        "We use the term transliteration to refer generally to the problem of the identification of a specific textual form in an output language (in our case Chinese characters) which corresponds to a specific textual form in an input language (an English word or phrase).",
        "For words with semantic content, this process is essentially equivalent to the translation of individual words.",
        "So, the English word \"black\" is associated with a concept which is expressed as \"m\" ([hën) in Chinese.",
        "In this case, a dictionary search establishes the input-output correspondence.",
        "For words with little or no semantic content, such as personal and place names, dictionary lookup may suffice where standard translations exist, but in general it cannot be assumed that names will be included in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "In multilingual systems designed only for languages sharing the roman alphabet, such names pose no problem as they can simply be included unaltered in output texts in any of the languages.",
        "They cannot, however, be included in a Chinese text, as the roman characters cannot standardly be realized in the Han character set."

        "English-Chinese name transliteration occurs on the basis of pronunciation.",
        "That is, the written English word is mapped to the written Chinese character(s) via the spoken form associated with the word.",
        "The idealized process consists of:",
        "1. mapping an English word (grapheme) to a phonemic representation 2. mapping each phoneme composing the word to a corresponding Chinese character",
        "In practice, this process is not entirely straightforward.",
        "We outline several issues complicating the automation of this process below.",
        "The written form of English is less than normalized.",
        "A particular English grapheme (letter or letter group) does not always correspond to a single phoneme (e.g. ea is pronounced differently in eat, threat, heart, etc.",
        "), and many English multi-letter combinations are realised as a single phoneme in pronunciation (so f, if, ph, and gh can all map to /f/) (van den Bosch 1997).",
        "An important step in grapheme-phoneme conversion is the segmentation of words into syllables.",
        "However, this process is dependent on factors such as morphology.",
        "The syllabification of \"hothead\" divides the letter combination th, while the same combination corresponds to a single phoneme in \"bother\".",
        "Automatic identification of the phonemes in a word is therefore a difficult problem.",
        "Many approaches exist in the literature to solving the grapheme-phoneme conversion problem.",
        "Divay and Vitale (1997) review several of these, and introduce a rule-based approach (with 1,500 rules for English) which achieved 94.9% accuracy on one corpus and 64.37% on another.",
        "Van den Bosch (1997) evaluates instance-based learning algorithms and a decision tree algorithm, finding that the best of these algorithms can achieve 96.9% accuracy.",
        "Even when a reliable grapheme-to-phoneme conversion module can be constructed, the English-Chinese transliteration process is faced with the task of mapping phonemes in the source language to counterparts in the target language, difficult due to phonemic divergence between the two languages.",
        "English permits initial and final consonant clusters in syllables.",
        "Mandarin Chinese, in contrast, primarily has a consonant-vowel or consonant-vowel-[nasal consonant (/n/ or /o/)] syllable structure.",
        "English consonant clusters, when pronounced within the Chinese phonemic system, must either be reduced to a single phoneme or converted to a consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel structure by inserting a vowel between the consonants in the cluster.",
        "In addition to these phonotactic constraints, the range of Chinese phonemes is not fully compatible with those of English.",
        "For instance, Mandarin does not use the phoneme /v/ and so that phoneme in English words is realized as either /w/ or /f/ in the Chinese counterpart.",
        "We focus on the specific problem of country name transliteration from English into Chinese.",
        "The algorithm does not aim to specify general grapheme-phoneme conversion for English, but only for the subset of English words relevant to place name transliteration.",
        "This limited domain rarely exhibits complex morphology and thus a robust morphological module is not included.",
        "In addition, foreign language morphemes are treated superficially.",
        "Thus, the algorithm transliterates the \"-istan\" (a morpheme having meaning in Persian) of \"Afghanistan\" in spite of a standard transliteration which omits this morpheme.",
        "The transliteration process is intended to be based purely on phonetic equivalency.",
        "On occasion, country names will have some additional meaning in English apart from the referential function, as in \"The United States\".",
        "Such names are often translated semantically rather than phonetically in Chinese.",
        "However, this in not uniformly true, for example \"Virgin\" in \"British Virgin Islands\" is transliterated.",
        "We therefore introduce a dictionary lookup step prior to commencing transliteration, to identify cases which have a standard translation.",
        "The transliteration algorithm results in a string of Han characters, the ideographic script used for Chinese.",
        "While the dialects of Chinese share the same orthography, they do not share the same pronunciation.",
        "This algorithm is based on the Mandarin dialect.",
        "Because automation of this algorithm is our primary goal, the transliteration starts with a written source and it is assumed that the orthography represents an assimilated pronunciation, even though English has borrowed many country names.",
        "This is permitted only because the mapping from English phonemes to Chinese phonemes loses a large degree of variance: English vowel monothongs are flattened into a fewer number Chinese monothongs.",
        "However, Chinese has a larger set of diphthongs and triphthongs.",
        "This results in approximating a prototypical vowel by the closest match within the set of Chinese vowels."

        "By mapping the Pinyin transliterations arrived by our algorithm to this different set of characters, we can extend the domain to include personal names.",
        "In its present form, the algorithm will not always generate transliterations matching those which might be produced by a human transliterator due to the influence of historical factors or individual differences.",
        "However, the aim of the algorithm is to produce a transliteration understandable by readers of a Chinese text.",
        "While the algorithm mimics the intuitive superimposition of phonemic and phonotactic systems, the ultimate goals of the algorithm are generality and reliability.",
        "Indeed, the result from the example above corresponds to a standard transliteration.",
        "Thus the algorithm produces results which are recognisable.",
        "The degree to which the transliteration is recognised by the human speaker is dependent in part on the length of the original name.",
        "Longer names with many syllables are less recognisable than shorter",
        "names.",
        "The introduced phonemic conversion rules are merely those most common and further work will strengthen the generality of the tool.",
        "Further research will include a more formal analysis of the correspondences between English and Chinese phonemes.",
        "Furthermore, the algorithm is far from robust due to its current limited focus, and errors made in earlier stages are propagated and possibly magnified as the algorithm continues.",
        "Since place names and people's names originate from many cultures, this algorithm will not produce desirable results unless the written form exhibits some assimilation to English spelling.",
        "We are currently investigating the application of lazy learning techniques (as described by van den Bosch 1997) to learning the English naming word-phoneme correspondences from a corpus of names.",
        "Such a module could eventually replace our simplistic rule-based procedure, and could feed into the phoneme-Pinyin mapping module, ultimately resulting in greater accuracy.",
        "The applications of such an algorithm are countless.",
        "Currently, the process of finding a less common country, city, or county name is an arduous procedure.",
        "Because transliteration uses no semantic content, it is a obvious task for automation.",
        "This algorithm could also be applied in the character entry on a Chinese word processor or to index Chinese electronic atlases.",
        "When attached to a robust grapheme-to-phoneme module, the transliteration into Chinese characters is ultimately a mapping to Chinese-specific IPA phonetics, raising the possibility of speech synthesis of English names in Chinese, given that Pinyin is a phonemically normalized orthography."
