        "In our system, compounds are handled during the lexical analysis, while idioms are treated in the syntax, where they are treated as \"specialized lexemes\".",

        "Multiword expressions (henceforth MWE), are known to constitute a serious problem for natural language processing (NLP)1.",
        "In the case of translation, a proper treatment of MWE is a fundamental requirement, as few customers would tolerate a literal translation of such common expressions as entrer en vigueur 'to come into effect', mettre en oeuvre 'to implement', faire preuve 'to show' or faire connaissance 'to meet'.",
        "However, a simple glance at some of the current commercial translation systems shows that none of them can be said to handle MWEs in an appropriate fashion.",
        "As a matter of fact, some of them explicitely warn their users not to use multiword expressions.",
        "In this paper, we will first stress some fundamental properties of two classes of MWEs, compounds and idioms, and then present the treatment of idioms developed for our French-English ITS-2 translation system (cf. Ram-luck= 8.6 Wehrli, 1993)."

        "They correspond to a single unit, both syntactically and semantically.",
        "In contrast, idiomatic expressions do not generally constitute fixed, closed syntactic units.",
        "They do, however, behave as semantic units.",
        "For instance the complex syntactic expression casser du sucre sur le dos de guelgu'un, literally break some sugar on 'This distinction between compounds and idioms is also discussed in Wehrli (1997)",

        "Syntactically, such idioms correspond to verb phrases, with a fixed direct object argument (la main, in our example) and an open indirect object argument.",
        "Notice that this verb phrase is completely regular in its syntactic behaviour.",
        "In particular, it can can undergo syntactic operations such as adverbial modification, raising, passive, dislocation, etc., as examplified in (2b-d).",
        "With example (3), we have a much less common pattern, since the subject argument of the verb constitutes a chunk of the expression.",

        "The extent to which expressions can undergo modifications and other syntactic operations can vary tremendously from one expression to the next, and in the absence of a general explanation for this fact, each expression must be recorded with the list of its particular properties and constraints4.",
        "Given the categorial distinction (X° vs. XP) and other fundamental differences sketched above, compounds and idioms are treated very differently in our system.",
        "Compounds are simply listed in the lexicon as complex lexical units.",

        "As for their identification, it turns out to be a rather complex operation, which cannot be reliably carried out at a superficial level of representation.",
        "As we saw in the above examples, idiom chunks can be found far away from the (verbal) head with which they constitute an expression; they can also be modified in various ways, and so on.",
        "Preprocessing idioms, for instance during the lexical analysis, might therefore lead to lengthy, inefficient or unreliable treatments.",
        "We will argue that in order to drastically simplify the task of identifying idioms, it is necessary to undo whatever syntactic operations they might have undergone.",

        "Furthermore, the subject constituant bears the feature (+human], the head is marked as [-passive], meaning that this particular idiom cannot be pas-sivized.",
