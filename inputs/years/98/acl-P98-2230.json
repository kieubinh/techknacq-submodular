        "We introduce a stochastic grammatical channel model for machine translation, that synthesizes several desirable characteristics of both statistical and grammatical machine translation.",
        "As with the pure statistical translation model described by Wu (1996) (in which a bracketing transduction grammar models the channel), alternative hypotheses compete probabilistically, exhaustive search of the translation hypothesis space can be performed in polynomial time, and robustness heuristics arise naturally from a language-independent inversion-transduction model.",
        "However, unlike pure statistical translation models, the generated output string is guaranteed to conform to a given target grammar.",
        "The model employs only (1) a translation lexicon, (2) a context-free grammar for the target language, and (3) a bigram language model.",
        "The fact that no explicit bilingual translation rules are used makes the model easily portable to a variety of source languages.",
        "Initial experiments show that it also achieves significant speed gains over our earlier model."

        "Speed of statistical machine translation methods has long been an issue.",
        "A step was taken by Wu (Wu, 1996) who introduced a polynomial-time algorithm for the runtime search for an optimal translation.",
        "To achieve this, Wu's method substituted a language-independent stochastic bracketing transduction grammar (SBTG) in place of the simpler word-alignment channel models reviewed in Section 2.",
        "The SBTG channel made exhaustive search possible through dynamic programming, instead of previous \"stack search\" heuristics.",
        "Translation accuracy was not compromised, because the SBTG is apparently flexible enough to model word-order variation (between English and Chinese) even though it eliminates large portions of the space of word alignments.",
        "The SBTG can be regarded as a model of the language-universal hypothesis that closely related arguments tend to stay together (Wu, 1995a; Wu, 1995b).",
        "In this paper we introduce a generalization of Wu's method with the objectives of",
        "1. increasing translation speed further, 2. improving meaning-preservation accuracy, 3. improving grammaticality of the output, and 4. seeding a natural transition toward transduction rule models,",
        "under the constraint of • employing no additional knowledge resources except a grammar for the target language.",
        "To achieve these objectives, we:",
        "• replace Wu's SBTG channel with a full stochastic inversion transduction grammar or SITG channel, discussed in Section 3, and • (mis-)use the target language grammar as a SITG, discussed in Section 4.",
        "In Wu's SBTG method, the burden of generating grammatical output rests mostly on the bigram language model; explicit grammatical knowledge cannot be used.",
        "As a result, output grammaticality cannot be guaranteed.",
        "The advantage is that language-dependent syntactic knowledge resources are not needed.",
        "We relax those constraints here by assuming a good (monolingual) context-free grammar for the target language.",
        "Compared to other knowledge resources (such as transfer rules or semantic ontologies), monolingual syntactic grammars are relatively easy to acquire or construct.",
        "We use the grammar in the SITG channel, while retaining the bigram language model.",
        "The new model facilitates explicit coding of grammatical knowledge and finer control over channel probabilities.",
        "Like Wu's SBTG model, the translation hypothesis space can be exhaustively searched in polynomial time, as shown in",
        "Section 5.",
        "The experiments discussed in Section 6 show promising results for these directions."

        "One of the primary obstacles to making the statistical translation approach practical is slow speed of translation, as performed in A* fashion.",
        "This price is paid for the robustness that is obtained by using very flexible language and translation models.",
        "The language model allows sentences of arbitrary order and the translation model allows arbitrary word-order permutation.",
        "No structural constraints and explicit linguistic grammars are imposed by this model.",
        "The translation channel is characterized by two sets of parameters: translation and alignment probabilities.",
        "The translation probabilities describe lexical substitution, while alignment probabilities describe word-order permutation.",
