        "In machine translation systems, it is necessary to resolve ellipses when the source language doesn't express the subject or other grammatical cases and the target must express it.",
        "The problem of ellipsis resolution is also troublesome in information extraction and other natural language processing fields.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed to resolve ellipses, which consist of endophoric (intrasentential or anaphoric) ellipses and ex-ophoric (or extrasentential) ellipses.",
        "One of the major approaches for endophoric ellipsis in theoretical basis utilizes the centering theory.",
        "However, its application to complex sentences has not been established because most studies have only investigated its effectiveness with successive simple sentences.",
        "Several studies of this problem have been made using the empirical approach.",
        "Among them, Murata and Nagao (1997) proposed a scoring approach where each constraint is manually scored with an estimation of possibility, and the resolution is conducted by totaling the points each candidate receives.",
        "On the other hand, Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996) proposed a resolving algorithm for Japanese exophoric ellipses of written texts, utilizing semantic and pragmatic constraints.",
        "They claimed that 100% of the ellipses with exophoric referents could be resolved, but the experiment was a closed test with only a few samples.",
        "These approaches always require some effort to decide the scoring or the preference of provided constraints.",
        "Aone and Bennett (1995) applied a machine-learning technique to anaphora resolution in written texts.",
        "They attempted endophoric ellipsis resolution as a part of anaphora resolution, with approximately 40% recall and 74% precision at best from 200 test samples.",
        "However, they were not concerned with exophoric ellipsis.",
        "In contrast, we applied a machine-learning approach to ellipsis resolution (Yamamoto et al., 1997).",
        "In this previous work we resolved the agent case ellipses in dialogue, with a limited topic, and performed with approximately 90% accuracy.",
        "This does not sufficiently determine the effectiveness of the decision tree, and the feasibility of this technique in resolving ellipses by each surface case is also unclear.",
        "We propose a method to resolve the ellipses that appear in Japanese dialogues.",
        "This method resolves not only the subject ellipsis, but also the object and other grammatical cases.",
        "In this approach, a machine-learning algorithm is used to build a decision tree by selecting the necessary attributes, and the decision tree is used as the actual ellipsis resolver.",
        "Another purpose of this paper is to discuss how effective the machine-learning approach is",
        "in the problem of ellipsis resolution.",
        "In the following sections, we discuss topic-dependency in decision trees and compare the resolution effectiveness of each grammatical case.",

        "Among these candidates, most of the previous works with Japanese chose the source-language approach.",
        "For instance, Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996) attempted to resolve Japanese ellipsis in the source language analysis of J-to-E MT, despite utilizing target-dependent resolution candidates.",
        "We originally thought that ellipsis resolution in the MT was a generation problem, namely a target-driven problem which utilizes some help, if necessary, of source-language information.",
        "This is because the problem is output-dependent and it relies on demands from a target language.",
        "In the J-to-Korean or J-to-Chinese MT, all or most of the ellipses that must be resolved in J-to-E are not necessary to resolve.",
        "However, we adopted source-language policy in this paper, with the necessity that we consider a multilingual MT system TDMT (Furuse et al.. 1995), that deals with both J-to-E and J-to-German MT.",

        "The effective use of exophoric information, i.e., from the actual world, may perform well for resolving an ellipsis.",
        "Exophoric information consists of a lot of elements, such as the time, the place, the speaker, and the listener of the utterance.",
        "However, it is difficult to become aware of some of them, and some are rather difficult to prescribe.",
        "Thus we utilize one element, the speaker's social role, i.e., whether the speaker is the customer or the clerk.",
        "The reason for this is that it must be an influential attribute, and it is easy to detect in the actual world.",
        "Many of us would accept a real system such as a spoken-language translation system that detects speech with independent microphones.",
        "It is generally agreed that attributes to resolve ellipses should be different in each case.",
        "Thus although we have to prepare them on a case by case basis, we trained a resolver with the same attributes.",
        "Because we must deal with the noisy input that appears in real applications, the training attributes, other than the speaker's social role, are questioned on a morphological basis.",
        "We give each attribute its positional information, i.e., search space of morphemes from the target predicate.",
        "Positional information can be one of five kinds: before, at the latest, here, next, and afterward.",
        "For example, a case particle is given the position of 'before', the search position of a prefix `o-' or 'go-' is the 'latest', and an auxiliary verb is 'after' the predicate.",
