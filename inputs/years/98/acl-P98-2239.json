        "The strength of word association can be measured by mutual information.",
        "By computing mutual information of a word pair, we can get many useful preference information from the corpus, such as the semantic preference between noun and noun(e.g.\"doctor/nurse\"), the particular preference between adjective and noun(e.g.\"strong/currency\"), and solid structure (e.g.\"pay/attention\")[Calzolori90].",

        "Here, we will focus instead on the preferred relationships between words.",
        "The preference relationships between words can expand from a short to long distance.",
        "While N-gram models are simple in language modeling and have been successfully used in many tasks, they have obvious deficiencies.",
        "For instance, N-gram models can only capture the short-distance dependency within an N-word window where currently the largest practical N for natural language is three and many kinds of dependencies in natural language occur beyond a three-word window.",
        "While we can use conventional N-gram models to capture the short-distance dependency, the long-distance dependency should also be exploited properly.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to study the preferred relationships between words over a short or long distance and propose a new modeling approach to capture such phenomena in the Chinese language.",
