        "Several quantitative methods exist for thematically segmenting texts.",
        "Most of them are based on the following assumption: the thematic coherence of a text segment finds expression at the lexical level.",
        "Hearst (1997) and Nomoto and Nitta (1994) detect this coherence through patterns of lexical cooccurrence.",
        "Morris and Hirst (1991) and Kozima (1993) find topic boundaries in the texts by using lexical cohesion.",
        "The first methods are applied to texts, such as expository texts, whose vocabulary is often very specific.",
        "As a concept is always expressed by the same word, word repetitions are thematically significant in these texts.",
        "The use of lexical cohesion allows to bypass the problem set by texts, such as narratives, in which a concept is often expressed by different means.",
        "However, this second approach requires knowledge about the cohesion between words.",
        "Morris and Hirst (1991) extract this knowledge from a thesaurus.",
        "Kozima (1993) exploits a lexical network built from a machine readable dictionary (MRD).",
        "This article presents a method for thematically segmenting texts by using knowledge about lexical cohesion that has been automatically built.",
        "This knowledge takes the form of a network of lexical collocations.",
        "We claim that this network is as suitable as a thesaurus or a MRD for segmenting texts.",
        "Moreover, building it for a specific domain or for another language is quick."

      "text": [
        "As in Kozima's work, a cohesion value is computed at each position of a window in a text (after pre-processing) from the words in this window.",
        "The collocation network is used for determining how close together these words are.",
        "We suppose that if the words of the window are strongly connected in the network, they belong to the same domain and so, the cohesion in this part of text is high.",
        "On the contrary, if they are not very much linked together, we assume that the words of the window belong to two different domains.",
        "It means that the window is located across the transition from one topic to another.",
        "In practice, the cohesion inside the window is evaluated by the sum of the weights of the words in this window and the words selected from the collocation network common to at least two words of the window.",
        "Selecting words from the network linked to those of the texts makes explicit words related to the same topic as the topic referred by the words in the window and produces a more stable description of this topic when the window moves.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, each word w (from the window or from the network) is weighted by the sum of the contributions of all the words of the window it is linked to.",
        "The contribution of such a word is equal to its number of occurrences in the window modulated by the cohesion measure associated to its link with w. Thus, the more the words belong to a same topic, the more they are linked together and the higher their weights are.",
        "Finally, the value of the cohesion for one position of the window is the result of the following weighted sum:",
        "wght(wi), the resulting weight of the word wi, sign(wi), the significance of wi, i.e. the normalized information of wi in the Le Monde corpus.",

        "ated to the window center is re-evaluated as the mean of all the cohesion values in the window.",
        "After this smoothing, the derivative of the graph is calculated to locate the maxima and the minima.",
        "We consider that a minimum marks a thematic shift.",
        "So, a segment is characterized by the following sequence: minimum - maximum - minimum.",
        "For making the delimitation of the segments more precise, they are stopped before the next (or the previous) minimum if there is a brutal break of the graph and after this, a very slow descent.",

        "In order to have a more objective evaluation, the method has been applied to the \"classical\" task of discovering boundaries between concatened texts.",
        "Results are shown in Table 1.",
        "As in (Hearst, 1997), boundaries found by the method are weighted and sorted in decreasing order.",

        "Precision is",
        "given by Nt/Nb and recall, by NtIN, where N is the number of document breaks.",
        "Our evaluation has been performed with 39 texts coming from the Le Monde newspaper, but not taken from the corpus used for building the collocation network.",
        "Each text was 80 words long on average.",
        "Each boundary, which is a minimum of the cohesion graph, was weighted by the sum of the differences between its value and the values of the two maxima around it, as in (Hearst, 1997).",
        "The match between a boundary and a document break was accepted if the boundary was no further than 9 words (after pre-processing).",
        "Globally, our results are not as good as Hearst's (with 44 texts; Nb: 10, P: 0.8, R: 0.19; Nb: 70, P: 0.59, R: 0.95).",
        "The first explanation for such a difference is the fact that the two methods do not apply to the same kind of texts.",
        "Hearst does not consider texts smaller than 10 sentences long.",
        "All the texts of this evaluation are under this limit.",
        "In fact, our method, as Koz-ima's, is more convenient for closely tracking thematic evolutions than for detecting the major thematic shifts.",
        "The second explanation for this difference is related to the way the document breaks are found, as shown by the precision values.",
        "When Nb increases, precision decreases as it generally does, but very slowly.",
        "The decrease actually becomes significant only when Nb becomes larger than N. It means that the weights associated to the boundaries are not very significant.",
        "We have validated this hypothesis by changing the weighting policy of the boundaries without having significant changes in the results.",
        "One way for increasing the performance would be to take as text boundary not the position of a minimum in the cohesion graph but the nearest sentence boundary from this position."
