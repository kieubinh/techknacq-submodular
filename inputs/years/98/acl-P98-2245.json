        "This paper presents an algorithm to integrate different lexical resources, through which we hope to overcome the individual inadequacy of the resources, and thus obtain some enriched lexical semantic information for applications such as word sense disambiguation.",

        "Preliminary results support our hypothesised structural relationship, which enables the integration, of the resources.",

      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "It is generally accepted that applications such as word sense disambiguation (WSD), machine translation (MT) and information retrieval (IR), require a wide range of resources to supply the necessary lexical semantic information.",
        "For instance, Cal-zolari (1988) proposed a lexical database in Italian which has the features of both a dictionary and a thesaurus; and Klavans and Tzoukermann (1995) tried to build a fuller bilingual lexicon by enhancing machine-readable dictionaries with large corpora.",
        "Among the attempts to enrich lexical information, many have been directed to the analysis of dictionary definitions and the transformation of the implicit information to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amsler, 1981; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow et al., 1985; Markowitz et al., 1986; Klavans et al., 1990; Vossen and Copestake, 1993).",
        "Nonetheless, dictionaries are also infamous of their non-standardised sense granularity, and the taxonomies obtained from definitions are inevitably ad hoc.",
        "It would therefore be a good idea if we can unify our lexical semantic knowledge by some existing, and widely exploited, classifications such as the system in Roget's Thesaurus (Roget, 1852), which has remained intact for years and has been used in WSD (Yarowsky, 1992).",
        "While the objective is to integrate different lexical resources, the problem is: how do we reconcile the rich but variable information in dictionary senses with the cruder but more stable taxonomies like those in thesauri?",
        "This work is intended to fill this gap.",
        "We use WordNet as a mediator in the process.",
        "In the following, we will outline an algorithm to map word senses in a dictionary to semantic classes in some established classification scheme."

        "The three lexical resources used in this work are the 1987 revision of Roget's Thesaurus (ROGET) (Kirkpatrick, 1987), the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978) and WordNet 1.5 (WN) (Miller et al., 1993).",
        "Figure 1 shows how word senses are organised in them.",
        "As we have mentioned, instead of directly mapping an LDOCE definition to a ROGET class, we bridge the gap with WN, as indicated by the arrows in the figure.",
        "Such a route is made feasible by linking the structures in common among the resources.",
        "Words are organised in alphabetical order in LDOCE, as in other conventional dictionaries.",
        "The senses are listed after each entry, in the form of text definitions.",
        "WN groups words into sets of synonyms (\"synsets\"), with an optional textual gloss.",
        "These synsets form the nodes of a taxonomic hierarchy.",
        "In ROGET, each semantic class comes with a number, under which words are first assorted by part of speech and then grouped into paragraphs according to the conveyed idea.",
        "Let us refer to Figure 1 and start from word x2 in WN synset X.",
        "Since words expressing every aspect of an idea are grouped together in ROGET, we can therefore expect to find not only words in synset X, but also those in the coordinate WN synsets (i.e. M and P, with words ml, m2, 731, p2, etc.)",
        "and the superordinate WN synsets (i.e. C and A, with words c1, c2, etc.)",
        "in the same ROGET paragraph.",
        "In other words, the thesaurus class to which x2 belongs should include roughly XUMUPUCU A.",
        "Meanwhile, the LDOCE definition corresponding to the sense of synset X (denoted by Dx) is expected to be similar to the textual gloss of synset X (denoted by G/(X)).",
        "In addition, given that it is not unusual for",
        "A 120.",
        "N. cl, c2.... (in C); m1, m2, ... (in hi); pl.",
        "p2, ... (in P); xl, x2, ... (in X)",
        "dictionary definitions to be phrased with synonyms or superordinate terms, we would also expect to find words from X and C, or even A, in the LDOCE definition.",

      "text": [
        "The possibility of using statistical methods to assign ROGET category labels to dictionary definitions has been suggested by Yarowsky (1992).",
        "Our algorithm offers a systematic way of linking existing resources by defining a mapping chain from LDOCE to ROGET through WN.",
        "It is based on shallow processing within the resources themselves, exploiting their inter-relatedness, and does not rely on extensive statistical data.",
        "It therefore has an advantage of being immune to any change of sense discrimination with time, since it only depends on the organisation but not the individual entries of the resources.",
        "Given a word with part of speech, W (p), the core steps are as follows: Step 1: From LDOCE, get the sense definitions Di, ..., Dt under the entry W(p).",
        "Step 2: From WN, find all the synsets Sn {wi , w2, ...} such that W(p) E S. Also collect the corresponding gloss definitions, Gl(S), if any, the hypernym synsets Hyp(Sn), and the coordinate synsets Co(Sn).",
        "Step 3: Compute a similarity score matrix A for the LDOCE senses and the WN synsets.",
        "A similarity score A(i , j) is computed for the ith LDOCE sense and the jth WN synset using a weighted sum of the overlaps between the LDOCE sense and the WN synset, hypernyms, and gloss respectively, that is A(i, j) = ai IDi n Sit + adDi n Hyp(S3)1 + a3IDi n Gi(s;), For our tests, we tried setting al = 3, a2 = 5 and a3 = 2 to reveal the relative significance of finding a synonym, a hypernym, and any word in the textual gloss respectively in the dictionary definition.",
        "Step 4: From ROGET, find all paragraphs Prn {W1) W2, ...} such that W (p) E Pm.",
        "Step 5: Compute a similarity score matrix B for the WN synsets and the ROGET classes.",
        "A similarity score B(j, k) is computed for the jth WN synset (taking the synset itself, the hypernyms, and the coordinate terms) and the kth ROGET class, according to the following:",
        "We have set b1 = b2 = b3 = 1.",
        "Since a ROGET class contains words expressing every aspect of the same idea, it should be equally likely to find synonyms, hypernyms and coordinate terms in common.",
        "Step 6: For i = 1 to t (i.e. each LDOCE sense), find max(A(i, j)) from matrix A.",
        "Then trace from matrix B the ith row and find max(B(j, k)).",
        "The ith LDOCE sense should finally be mapped to the ROGET class to which Pk belongs.",
        "We have made an operational assumption about the analysis of definitions.",
        "We did not attempt to parse definitions to identify genus terms but simply approximated this by using the weights al, a2 and a3 in Step 3.",
        "Considering that words are often defined in terms of superordinates and slightly less often by synonyms, we assign numerical weights in the order a2 > al > a3.",
        "We are also aware that definitions can take other forms which may involve part-of relations, membership, and so on, though we did not deal with them in this study."

      "text": [
        "Overall, the Accurately Mapped figures support our hypothesis that conventional dictionaries and thesauri can be related through WordNet.",
        "Looking at the unsuccessful cases, we see that there are relatively more \"false alarms\" than \"misses\", showing that errors mostly arise from the inadequacy of individual resources because there are no targets rather than from partial failures of the process.",
        "Moreover, the number of \"misses\" can possibly be reduced if more definition patterns are considered.",
        "Clearly the successful mappings are influenced by the fineness of the sense discrimination in the resources.",
        "How finely they are distinguished can be inferred from the similarity score matrices.",
        "Reading the matrices row-wise shows how vaguely a certain sense is defined, whereas reading them column-wise reveals how polysemous a word is.",
        "While the links resulting from the algorithm can be right or wrong, there were some senses of the test words which appeared in one resource but had no counterpart in the others, i.e. they were not attached to any links.",
        "Thus 18.9% of the LDOCE senses, 11.1% of the WN synsets and 58.1% of the ROGET classes were among these unattached senses.",
        "Though this implies the insufficiency of us"
