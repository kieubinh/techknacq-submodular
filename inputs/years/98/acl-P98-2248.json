        "When should Spanish detener translate to English arrest and when to stop?",
        "This paper explores the problem of lexical selection in machine translation (MT): a given source language (SL) word can often be translated into different target language (TL) words, depending on the context.",
        "Translation is difficult because the conceptual mapping between languages is generally not one-to-one; e.g. Spanish reloj maps to both watch and clock.",
        "A SL word might be translatable by more than one TL option, where the choice is based on stylistic or pragmatic rather than semantic criteria.",
        "Alternative TL choices also exist for SL words that are ambiguous from the monolingual point of view; e.g. English firm can be translated by Spanish firme, estricto, sOlido or compaiiia."

        "In this paper I take a statistical approach to lexical selection, under the working assumption that the translated linguistic context can provide sufficient information for choosing the appropriate target.",
        "I define the appropriate target as the candidate \"closest\" in meaning to the local TL context, where local context refers to a window of words centered on the \"missing\" TL item.",
        "To estimate the similarity in meaning between a word and the bag of words forming a context, the semantic properties of words are first represented as their patterns of co-occurrence in a large corpus.",
        "Viewing a word as a vector in high dimensional \"semantic space\" allows distributional similarity (or \"semantic distance\") to be measured using a standard vector similarity metric.",
        "The assumption that distributional similarity corresponds to the psychological concept of semantic relatedness has proved useful in NLP (e.g. Schiitze, 1992), and for psycholinguistic modelling (e.g. Landauer & Dumais, 1997).",
        "One way to estimate the semantic distance between a local discourse context and a target word is to measure the proximity between the centroid vector created from the words in the context and the target word vector.",
        "This approach was used successfully by Schiitze (1992) in a small-scale word sense disambiguation experiment.",
        "However, in this approach the distributional properties of the words making up the local context are not taken into account.",
        "The centroid method establishes one position (the mean) on each dimension to use in the distance estimate, without considering the variability of the values on all dimensions.",
        "If there is a large amount of noise in the context (semantically irrelevant words), the centroid is influenced equally by these words as by words that are relevant to the correct target.",
        "Weighting the dimensions of the space according to variability allows a semantic distance measure to be influenced less by irrelevant dimensions (Kozimo & Ito, 1995).",
        "It is clear that this method relies on the hypothesis that the region of semantic space defined by the translated context \"overlaps\" to a greater degree with the preferred target than with the alternative choices.",
        "The main purpose of the present investigation was to determine the extent that this hypothesis was supported."

        "makes a decision if the preference is statistically significant.",
        "In work aimed at lexical choice in generation, Edmonds (1997) uses information about significant local co-occurrences to choose which of a set of synonyms is most typical in a given context.",
        "The present paper differs from these approaches in that local co-occurrence behaviour is not considered relevant, but rather an estimate of semantic relatedness between the TL context and each candidate translation."

        "The test corpus was an English language movie script that had been translated into Spanish on a line-by-line basis.",
        "A random sample of 170 lines was extracted from the Spanish half of the corpus, and each content 'word in this SL subcorpus was looked up in the online version of Langenscheidt's New College English-Spanish Bilingual Dictionary.2 Experimental items were chosen and a bilingual lexicon (see Figure 1) formed from the information in the dictionary, subject to the following constraints:",
        "• The SL word had two or more potential translations.",
        "• A potential translation was defined as a listed translation matching the SL word in POS class (and for verbs, in valency).",
        "This simulates the information available from parsing or tagging.",
        "• Only word-to-word translations were considered.",
        "Multi-word units in the SL text or listed as a translation were excluded.",
        "• Very low frequency SL words and listed translations (a lexeme frequency of less than 1/million in the 10M word spoken part of the British National Corpus [BNC]) were excluded.",
        "The translations given in the parallel corpus for 13 SL items were not listed in Langenscheidt's.",
        "This was due to the directionality of bilingual dictionaries – entries are created from the TL point of view – and the fact that the direction of original translation was opposite to that used for building the testing lexicon.",
        "These translations were incorporated into the bilingual lexicon.",
        "A total of 99 experimental items were compiled.",
        "For each SL item, the corresponding TL translation was located in the parallel corpus and all U content words within a ±25 word window were extracted to form the local discourse context.",
        "Co-occurrence vectors for each lemmatised context word meeting the frequency threshold were created from a lemmatised version of the spoken part of the BNC.",
        "Vectors were constructed by advancing a window of ±3 words through the corpus, and for each word recording the number of times each of 446 index words occurred within the window.",
        "This procedure produced a 446-dimension semantic space.",
        "Finally, co-occurrence counts were replaced with their log-likelihood values, which effectively normalizes the vectors.",
        "Parameter settings were taken from McDonald (1997).",
        "Vectors for the translation candidates were created using exactly the same method.",
        "Compared to a practical MT system, the lexical selection simulation makes several simplifying assumptions.",
        "For one, two or more items in the same SL sentence are treated as if all other items are already correctly translated.",
        "Secondly, the use of forward context means that a word is left untranslated until a prespecified number of following words are translated.",
        "Finally, the bilingual lexicon listed 4.2 translation candidates per entry on average.",
        "Many of the alternatives could be described as stylistic variants, and might not be present in an actual MT lexicon."
