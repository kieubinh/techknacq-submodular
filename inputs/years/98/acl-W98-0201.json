        "This paper introduces a new approach for improving hypermedia design, by providing the author with a tool to visualise, examine, and analyse the structure of documents containing hypermedia !inks.",
        "Our proposal is a new representation method the purpose of which is not to show the document structure in graphical form in order to enable the users to know where they are, where they can go next, or to give an overview of their environment Mt The purpose of our representation method is to depict what options the users are about to be offered.",
        "so that the author can examine the structure in order to better guide them around the information space.",
        "Our representation is shown in the form of a map consisting of a proposed classification of elements that define the composition of a hyperdocument.",
        "To extract and classify those attributes we have analysed in detail all three dimensions of the hypermedia cube: internal dynamics, external visual appearance and content synthesis.",
        "After introducing our diagrammatic notation we give a brief example of how it could be applied to an existing hypermedia application.",
        "In the houndaries of this paper, we include the part of the method which represents the structure of just one hypermedia document and its linked branches.",

        "Having achieved that, we will start automating the process of creating the Pausanian maps for Microcosm applications, by adding the appropriate functions to the Microcosm Make-Link feature, The fact that Microcosm keeps all the link information stored in a linkbase file, makes it much easier to extract any information needed for producing the different Pausanian Maps.",
