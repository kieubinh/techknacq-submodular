        "Extracting necessary information easily from the bulk of information available throughout the world is crucial for people living in this highly computerized society, and therefore, it is necessary to develop systems which can visually present the selected information necessary to assist people in forming new concepts.",
        "A great deal of work on this subject has been done by various researchers, e.g., information retrieval from newspaper articles and message understanding in newspaper articles.",
        "It is not sufficient that this kind of expert system simply imitate the real world.",
        "Such systems have to create a richer environment with the visual interface than there is now.",
        "This means not simply supplying an imitation of the real world, but actively building a virtual world where the density of information is higher than that of the real world for a given use.",
        "In other words, we need information screening for each individual user.",
        "Therefore, technology which selects and presents the necessary information will be the key to information retrieval in the future.",
        "As an application of this kind of technology to the Internet, we are developing an Intelligent Network News Reader (HISHO: Helpful Information Selection by Hunting On-line) which extracts news articles for users and which visually displays the structure of articles.",
        "In contrast to ordinary information retrieval and abstract generation, this method utilizes an \"information context\" to select articles from newsgroups on the Internet.",
        "We finished our prototype of the Intelligent Network News Reader in March 1998 and will complete a final practical version in March 2000.",
        "In this paper, we discuss how to find topic changing articles in the tree structures of news articles, how to extract topic differences from the thread of articles, and how to indicate this information in the display to help users decide which part of the tree structures of articles they will read.",
        "2 Information Gathering from the Network News Network news has recently become very popular worldwide, and the number of articles generated every day is increasing rapidly.",
        "Also the quality of information in these articles varies widely.",
        "This makes the percentage of important information lower and lower.",
        "Many people use or want to use Internet news.",
        "However, since it is not possible to read all the articles received, it is difficult to find articles on a specific topic and it is difficult to determine from these articles, which are relevant to one's specific interests, especially where the author of the article neglected to use a suitable subject, i.e., title.",
        "This situation, i.e., articles without suitable subjects, often occurs and thus, it is not easy to retrieve information utilizing a simple keyword-based method.",
        "Some research on such problems, i.e., on gathering information efficiently, has been done, but most of the research has been limited to generating abstracts or extracting some topics.",
        "However, they are immature and still have many problems.",

        "There is much ongoing research in information retrieval.",
        "In document retrieval, the key technology is the utilization of keywords, titles, and user defined \"key words\" (Jacobs, 1992).",
        "Full text search is now very fast using some programming techniques.",
        "TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) by ARPA includes this kind of approach (Harma.n, 1994).",
        "One of the targets of the summarization and information extraction domains is to plug information into some templates.",
        "MITC (Message Understanding Conference) by ARPA is involved in doing this kind of work (A.RPA, 1993).",
        "However, these approaches are not suitable for information retrieval from the network news on the Internet.",
        "Therefore, there have been many proposals for network news readers.",
        "For example, \"Galaxy of News\" retrieves sets of information related to one another by adopting a stochastic method to produce a hierarchy of keywords and it presents the results of the search visually, i.e., 3-dimensionally (Rennison, 1994).",
        "However, users have to manually chose the articles they want to read.",
        "Another program which assists users in selecting articles they should read is the \"Personalized Electronic News Editor\" (Sheth, 1994).",
        "First, a user instructs the agents who are in charge of information retrieval of his/her preferences.",
        "Then, they extract keywords, chose articles using the extracted keyword, and recommend the chosen articles to the user.",
        "There is also research being done on the summarization of news articles to help people who read the network news (Sato, 1994).",
        "Although this is a very useful research domain, when we think of the actual user needs for a network news reader, these needs are not being met.",
        "Users generally want to read the whole article relevant to their interests, and they are not satisfied reading abstracts.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to display not only the summary conceived in terms but the whole relevant section of the original articles.",
        "Also, we have to be aware of the following point.",
        "There are two types of network news.",
        "The first is newswire-like newsgroups, which are similar to the ordinary newspaper and which makes various announcements, such as meetings, job opportunities, and so on.",
        "Of course, these newsgroups are very informative, but they do not contain such a large number of articles.",
        "The second is newsgroups for discussion among users.",
        "This is where people discuss things, the topic for which has been introduced by one of them.",
        "Each article in the newswire-like newsgroups is mainly self-contained, therefore, it is possible to retrieve previous articles dealing with the same subject by using simple keyword-based technology.",
        "However, articles in the newsgroups for discussion are neither semantically nor referentially self-contained.",
        "The previously mentioned \"Personalized Electronic News Editor\" and summarization systems are for articles in the newswire-like newsgroups.",

        "Network news is a good knowledge source and the expectation is that the articles are well organized.",
        "The assumption is that related articles should have the same title or be linked together by information in a reference field and that non-related articles should have different titles.",
        "However, often this is not true.",
        "Recent news reader systems which utilize this kind of information to classify news articles have been misleading.",
        "We checked two newsgroups, specifically, 13.1ifelealth and fj.sci.medical.",
        "Iii fj.lifelealth, we found 52.5 disjointed parts in 1431 articles over 13 months using their reference fields, and in fj.sci.medical, we found 692 disjointed parts in 1683 articles.",
        "For example, in fj.life.health, 209 articles had no relation to other articles explicitly, however, 61 of these had some relation to the others when we checked their content.",
        "Also, some parts which involved more than one article were semantically related to the other parts.",
        "This indicates that if we use the reference field to find relations between articles, many of these would not be extracted.",
        "The subject field of each article seems informative, however, news writers do not tend to change the subject even if they change the topic of their articles from the former one.",
        "We found during our experiment that the subject is not very informative and it is not efficient if a news reader presents all articles with the same subject to users.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary for the Intelligent Network News Reader to have a way of gathering all the relations between articles based on their content.",
        "We propose a system which sees the articles in network news as a kind of conversational text, which goes upstream in the flow of topics for articles, considering references, quotations and the relative importance between words and/or sentences, and which extracts and visually displays articles which have user relevant information."

        "In this paper, we clarify problems which prevent the effective use of information on the network news, and we propose a way of extracting the necessary information by focusing on the consistency of topics in the articles.",
        "We also propose a way of displaying the extracted information visually to assist users in reading informative news articles effectively.",
        "We also attempt to solve the problems.",
        "Our system has the following features: it treats the article in which the user is interested as a key to information retrieval, weighs the relative importance between sentences by using natural language processing technology, and it utilizes heuristics on the features of the network news assuming it to be a kind of conversational text.",
        "Typical usage of this system would be: the user is very busy and cannot keep up with the recent news, he/she gets some free time and takes a look at today's news articles which are extracted from a huge set of unread articles.",
        "He/she finds one very interesting article and wants to read all the articles pertaining to that topic, enough to understand whole discussion.",
        "So, what should the news reader do to help him/her?",
        "A news reader for busy people needs not only make an abstract of the recent news – since the abstraction process can drop some important information – but to choose the suitable thread to follow on the basis of the content of the news articles.",
        "We therefore propose the concept of \"information con-text\" defined by the structural distribution of words in the articles.",
        "Using this context, the user can follow a suitable thread, even if some articles are lacking a suitable subject.",
        "To make a decision regarding article retrieval or summary generation, it is not enough to give such a system keywords or a title in the subject field of the news.",
        "Recently developed news readers classify news items using their subjects, however, since the subject often differs from the contents of the article, many unnecessary articles are extracted by such a simple screening method.",
        "A keyword method can be useful when one knows what information he/she wants, or when one precisely knows the hierarchy of keywords, e.g., a thesaurus.",
        "When one is in the process of forming a new concept from his/her basic concept, it is not possible to chose a suitable keyword.",
        "The human conception process begins from the basic stage, passes into the thinking stage with the process of extracting related news, and clarifies its target and/or its result.",
        "Our intelligent news reader is expected to improve the efficiency of the retrieval of network news, and is also expected to be a tool for assisting some intelligent activities by humans.",
        "Here, the key to retrieval is not the keyword or titles which are decided by the users based on their own intuition, but the relevant article itself.",
        "In other words, this system allows information retrieval through the use of ambiguous keys.",
        "It is not necessary for the user to enter any concrete keywords or titles of articles.",
        "He/she simply needs to point to the article which he/she is interested in.",

        "The user begins to read articles and finds a news article which fits his interests.",
        "The selected article is called the focus article (FA).",
        "An RT including the FA is called a family tree.",

        "Sometimes an RT has a lot of articles.",
        "In that case, it is possible that the RT includes several topics.",
        "So, HISHO identifies a topic-changing article in the FT.",
        "The feature of the FT is calculated by using the score of terms in articles of the FT.",
        "The terms in the FA add the special score.",
        "The system calculates features of the RTs including the FT and gathers similar RTs.",
