        "In order for these approaches to be efficient and cost-effective, we must develop fully automatic methods for creating and processing text metadata for multimedia information.",
        "It may be possible to do this by compromising the quality of metadata (perhaps by using unedited speech recognition from Informedia): a future experiment would be to attempt this compromise and discover the effect on search performance."
