        "In this paper, we describe a tool for the visualization of process protocols produced by the parsing and semantic interpretation modules in a complex machine translation system.",
        "These protocols tend to reach considerable sizes, and error tracking in them is tedious and time-consuming.",
        "We show how the data in the protocols can be made more easily accessible by extracting a procedural trace, by splitting the protocols into a collection of cross-linked hypertext files, by indexing the files, and by using simple text formatting and sorting of structural elements."

        "Figure 1 sketches the flow of processing.",
        "The input text is first segmented and tagged with morphological information.",
        "It is then parsed and interpreted semantically.",
        "The result of semantic interpretation is finally fed into the text generation module.",
        "Almost all modules relevant to the discussion here employ bottom up chart parsing mechanisms.",
        "For any given input, they may return more than one interpretation, as the sample parse sequence for the string saw the ape with his binoculars in Figure 2 illustrates.",
        "The processes of parsing and semantic interpretation are recorded step by step in process protocols.",
        "A parse step in our system is equivalent to the creation of a new parse node.",
        "Each node receives a category label which determines",
        "its behavior in the remainder of the parsing process.",
        "A new parse node can be created in order to",
        "• integrate a new text element into the parse space, • combine two or more exisisting nodes into one node, or • change the category of an existing node by making it the daughter of the new node, and assigning a different category label to the new node.",
        "If, for any given range of input text, there are two interpretations that result in the same category label, they are combined into one node.",
        "For example, parse step No.",
        "6 in Figure 2 creates a node that comprises two interpretations.",
        "Each node in the parse tree also has a feature structure associated with it.",
        "This feature",
        "structure specifies various properties of the con SYN PUS verb] stituent represented by the respective node.",
        "A PERSON 3rd feature structure is a set of attribute-value pairs, NUMBER sg where a value can either be atomic (something that cannot be described in terms of having particular features or properties), or an embedded feature structure.",
        "Typical forms of representation are attribute-value matrices (AVMs), and graphs with labeled arcs and nodes.",

        "During semantic interpretation, the feature SURFACE PERSON rd structures introduced by the parser are augmented by semantic features assigned to the nodes by semantic interpretation rules (Knight NUMBER SENI and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995).",

        "Since ambiguities are packed NP for 'noun phrase'; into one node (instead of spelling them out • the nodes dominated by the node, or, if the by creating multiple nodes), a nonterminal node is a terminal node, the corresponding node may have several sets of daughters (cf. lexical symbol (a word or morpheme) from node No.",

        "Figures 4 and 5 show sample sections from a process protocol in raw format and as displayed by the visualization tool.",
        "2 Analysis of the Data Apart from the obvious, explicit information expressed in the protocol entry of each node – the node number, the immediate daughters of the node, and the features associated with it – the process protocol also contains some implicit information which can be retrieved by going through the protocol as a whole.",
        "For example, it is possible to check whether a node is used later on in the parsing process and what its mother node(s) is.",
        "Going down the tree, it can be determined which part of the input sentence is covered by a particular node.",
        "The 'parse forest' (collection of parse trees) can be reconstructed by linking the individual branchings (minimal trees consisting of a mother node and its daughter node(s)) by virtue of the node numbers.",
        "Last but not least, the original input sentence can be recovered by concatenating the leaf nodes of' the tree.",
        "Individual parse trees are two-dimensional, the two dimensions being precedence (the linear order in which the elements occur in the sentence) and dominance (the, relation between a mother node and its daughter node(s)).",
        "Even though both relations are preserved in the process protocols, none of them is immediately obvious from the protocols: Nodes that are neighbors in terms of linear order, or nodes that are connected in terms of dominance do not necessarily appear next to each other in the parse sequence.",
        "Consider, for example, the parse sequence in Figure 2.",
        "The node created by step 1 is used again in the steps 3 and 6.",
        "Whereas for step 3 the sister nodes 1 and 2 happen to be adjacent, this is not true for step 6.",
        "Here, the two nodes that make up the first interpretation are separated by the nodes 2, 3 and 4.",
        "Equally, the don-finance relation between parse nodes is usually obscured by intermediate parse steps.",
        "If we also take into account the issue of ambiguity, we have to deal with it as a third dimension, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "Keeping in mind the purpose of examining the data, which is first and above all error tracing and quality control, we can thus distinguish four aspects of the information contained in the process protocols.",
        "These aspects are:",
        "• the overall structure, i.e., information about the constituent structure (parse forest) of the sentence, and about the way it is built up from lexical items; • the details, i.e., information about the properties of the constitutents as preserved in the feature structures associated with",
        "\"above\" \"since' ''grate r than\" \"the end\" \"as long as\" \"the above-mentioned\" \"more than\" \"beyond\" \"not less than\" \"in excess or \"and up \"over)",

        "and the input, i.e., information about the connection of each node in the parse sequence to the part of the sentence that is covered by this node, and, in reverse, the connection of each word or morpheme of the input to the node that integrates this word or morpheme into the parse sequence.",
        "Whereas the connection of each node to the input can be considered a property of the respective node, the connection of the input to the parse sequence is a matter of indexing that will ease access to 'trouble spots' when testing changes to the syntactic grammar or the semantic interpretation rules."

        "The obvious solution to the issue of visualizing the overall constitutent structure of a sentence, namely displaying it as a conventional parse tree representation, turns out to be not very practical at closer examination.",
        "Since some parsers employed in our system may feturn more than just one structure for any given input, and since",
        "partial parses are very relevant for debugging, we are, in fact, not dealing with a single parse tree but rather with a 'parse forest' which may contain dozens or even hundreds of complete and partial trees.",
        "A development tool that confronts the developer with a large number of spelled-out ambiguities is not satisfactory, because it does not allow efficient access to relevant areas in the data space.",
        "Moreover, even in cases where there is only one single parse tree, the tree may not fit on the screen, and even if it does, there will be little room left to display the feature structures associated with each node.",
        "Therefore, instead of using conventional tree representations, the parse sequence is maintained as such and displayed as a cross-linked sequence of minimal trees, essentially in the same way it is recorded in the process protocol.",
        "However, it is formatted in a manner that supports the correct interpretation of the symbols as mother and daughter(s) (cf. the lower left frame in Figure 5).",
        "In addition, the explicit information contained in the individual entries of the process protocols is augmented by information that can be inferred from the process protocol as a whole and will not be visible when just looking at the protocol.",
        "Note, for example, that category labels are given not only for the mother node but also for the daughter nodes, and that the mother-daughter relation contained in the individual protocol entry is back-referenced to the daughter nodes in the HTML representation, so that the subsequent use of the node can be traced easily.",
        "In contrast, detailed information about the properties of the individual constituents, which tends to obstruct the view of the overall structure, is removed from this trace of display and stored in a separate file.",
        "Nevertheless it is readily at hand by means of hyperlinks, as will be explained immediately below.",
        "What is not visible in Figure 5 is that all category labels, and the node numbers in subscript after the category labels of daughter and parent nodes, are hyperlinks.",
        "A mouse click on a category label causes the browser to display the feature structure associated with that node in the frame on the right.",
        "A click on the node number leads to the respective node within the same (left) frame.",
        "This setup provides the user with the means to easily navigate the parse tree or parse forest, and, at the same time, allows him or her to inspect the features associated with each node in detail.",
        "In both frames, ambiguities (multiple structures associated with one node) are preserved by marking the alternatives with clear headings.",
        "Since parse sequence and feature structures are separated and displayed in different, adjoining frames in the browser, a very compact yet informative form of data visualization is achieved.",
        "3.2 Visualization of the Relation between Constitutent Structure and Input Text",
        "Before we turn to the representation of feature structures, let us briefly comment on the top frame in Figure 5.",
        "This frame displays the text of the original input sentence and serves two purposes.",
        "First, a click on the caption [show range) in either one of the lower framesi causes the browser to display the range covered by that node in red (as opposed to black for the surrounding context), and, secondly, in the 'clickable' mode of the top frame the input sentence serves as an index: a click on a word leads to the respective node in the parse sequence in the lower left frame, so that particular points of interest can be accessed easily during the grammar development process."
