        "CabriII (or Cabri-gÃªometre II) is a direct manipulation program for interactive \"exploration\" of geometrical diagrams (Laborde, 85).",
        "Many mathematics teachers and mathematicians use it for teaching or for their own work.",
        "It is the result of a tight collaboration between mathematicians, software researchers, educators, and teachers in everyday contact with pupils.",
        "Using this software, the user is immersed in an intelligent microworld.",
        "CabriII is an excellent learning environment for geometry (Laborde, 89), (Laborde, 95).",
        "Users construct geometrical diagrams and create new tools with macro-constructions.",
        "A teacher can profile the environment for specific learning tasks by embedding macro-constructions in his or her own tools.",
        "Through interactive manipulation of geometrical constructions, a pupil may for instance observe invariant properties and recognize them as constraints.",
        "All objects (for example, geometric objects and interface elements) are manipulated directly.",
        "Figure 1 shows a geometrical diagram drawing in CabriII.",
        "The diagram represents a point A, a line D and some other geometrical objects used to construct the symmetrical point (called B) of point A with respect to the line.",
        "Cabrill can store as \"macros\" construction methods which users try out.",
        "This term is commonly used in the domain of programming by demonstration.",
        "The aim of writing a macro is to define a new tool by using a list of repeatedly invoked constructions (Sugiura, 96).",
        "For instance, it is possible to define a macro to construct the symmetric point of a given point with respect to a line.",
        "As a matter of fact, CabriII does not store the whole construction, but only its \"useful\" part, determined automatically when the user indicates the \"initial\" and \"final\" objects of the construction.",
        "This method lets the user decide to construct a macro after embarking on a complex construction, rather than before.",
        "It also minimizes the length of the macro (which is strongly related to the number of objects retained).",
        "A consequence of this freedom is that a macro definition has to pass a validation test which can fail for various reasons, such as omission of necessary initial objects, dependency loops (in which an initial object depends on a final object), etc.",
        "Figure 2 shows the dependencies between geometrical objects in the definition of a construction method for drawing the symmetric point of a given point.",
        "The method chosen is the same as in figure 1.",
        "The object names are written in order of their creation, from left to right.",
        "The names written in single quotes are the names displayed in the diagram, and arrows are used to represent object dependencies.",
        "The selected initial object names are surrounded by thin rectangles, and the selected final objects by thicker ones.",
        "The macro creation process extracts the smallest graph that connects the final objects to the initial ones.",
        "Notice that the macro obtained may not correspond exactly to the user's expectations if s/he has made mistakes in certain construction choices.",
        "In that case, the user must debug the macro.",
        "Using the text form is far better for that purpose than redoing the whole construction."

      "text": [
        "In mathematics, graphical visualization is a fundamental support for reasoning (Zimmermann, 91).",
        "The appearance of dynamic geometry opens new doors by making the concept of di-agraming more accessible: simply drawing, by contrast, is more static and discrete.",
        "However, in purely graphical interfaces, the choices which guide the construction of various diagram objects can only be tracked down by observing their effect, i.e. by observing the relative behavior of the objects throughout diagram deformations.",
        "There is no longer direct access to the causes, only to the consequences.",
        "The information displayed is not a complete history including the creation, deformations and deletion of all objects, but rather only a record of the construction steps (dependencies) of the stored objects.",
        "One way to display all of the constraints for the whole diagram would be to display the program which drew the diagram.",
        "Similarly, we can observe that macro definition is closely related to classical programming, so that a textual medium becomes an absolute must.",
        "We can also add to the software the full range of classical programming environment tools, such as a step-by-step replay tool associated with cursor progression, or a tool aiding visualization of the correspondence between object value and graphic rendering.",
        "Specific tools associated with the relevant domain (dynamic geometry) are also useful.",
        "For instance, the use of color allows visualization of dependencies between objects, and aids debugging if the macro validation fails."

        "In the case of a multirnodal interface in a geometry program, ubiquity can be applied to geometrical objects such as points, straight lines, circles, conics, and so on as shown below: to construct a new geometrical object, the user selects a tool, then goes to the diagram and specifies the objects to which that tool is to be applied.",
        "Only objects whose types are appropriate for the current tool can be selected.",
        "Cabrill produces demonstration strings which help the user to choose which objects to select and to understand how they will be used by the current tool.",
