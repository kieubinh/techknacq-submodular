        "Whether blind, visually impaired, or sighted, our quality of life is greatly dependent on our ability to make informed spatial decisions.",
        "Space is fundamental to human existence and has great influence on human thinking.",
        "Access to representations of the geographic world (a map for example) are frequently denied a blind individual due to his or her lack of sight.",
        "For a long time tactile maps have sought to solve this problem.",
        "Tactile maps are static, cumbersome to create and have many associated cartographic problems.",
        "The fingertip's resolution is far less than the eye, it perceives serially – its \"bandwidth\" is very low compared to vision.",
        "The sighted cartographer is faced with the problems of simplification, generalisation, classification and symbolisation to render a visual map tactile.",
        "A common problem with tactile maps is labelling.",
        "Braille labelling is inflexible and when enough labels are applied to facilitate suitable understanding the map often becomes cluttered and illegible (Tatham 1991).",
        "Using labels in a separate legend or key reduces the immediacy of the graphic and introduces interpretative problems as referencing is disrupted (Hinton 1993).",
        "Technologies are evolving to help address some of these problems.",
        "The aim of this research is to create a way of accessing map information that is easy to learn and use, and supports interaction that is natural, flexible and efficient.",
        "It is hoped that this will expand the availability of maps to a broader spectrum of the population."

        "One development that has great potential to solve this problem is hypermedia.",
        "Hypermedia which comprises of text, still imagery, sound recordings (even tactile and olfactory output) is a network of information 'linked electronically by multiple routes, chains, or trails in an open-ended, perceptually unfinished assemblage described best in terms of links, nodes, networks, webs and paths' (Landow 1992, p.3).",
        "A well known example of a hypermedia environment would be the World Wide Web.",
        "Within a hypermedia environment a user can navigate between textual and cartographic information nodes in order to get a well documented, multifaceted representation of space, from varied sources and differing viewpoints (Milleret-Raffort 1995).",
        "A hypermedia document (if structured correctly) should allow a seamless navigation through the document, passing through various media, following a line of thought or inquiry.",
        "Conventional hypermedia systems are designed for predominantly visual in nature.",
        "They can, however, also offer people with visual impairments a way of exploring the world (Jacobson and Kitchin, in press) Non-visual hypermedia systems seek to provide sensory substitution with spoken audio information replacing textual and image based information.",
        "Such a system now exists for blind users on the World Wide Web (Webspeak 1995).",
        "Here, images are bypassed, textual information is converted to speech, and hypertext links are explained.",
        "There has been a long period of development of auditory alternatives to the visually dominant Graphical User Interface (GUI), for example, Soundtrack (Edwards, 1989); Karsluner and Oliver (1993); The Graphical User Interface for Blind People Project (GLTIB- Savidis and Stephanidis, 1995); the Mercator Project (Mynatt, 1997).",
        "These developments are important as they allow a blind user to work in parallel with their sighted counterpart.",
        "However, the development of systems for accessing spatial information (map-like information, rather than pull-down menus and screen icons) has been lacking.",
        "There are few notable exceptions (see Kurze and Holmes, 1996; Kurze 1997).",
        "Maps are of crucial importance, as they have the ability to not only present information with an academic view of the world but have the potential to impact on the daily living problems facing blind people.",
        "As such they can lead to an improved quality of life through enhanced, orientation, mobility and independence."

        "A GIS front end, ArcView, was used to construct a spatial system for visually impaired people (legally blind, but with some residual vision).",
        "The GUI was stripped down and many unnecessary component buttons and menus removed.",
        "The final system worked in two modes, a low vision zoom and pan query mode which displayed a map of the campus.",
        "With a single mouse click users could zoom-in to the area selected.",
        "By re-clicking the mouse button the user continued zooming-in until the area in question filled the display.",
        "With a further click an audio file was played, 'speaking the name of the building.",
        "Finally a large photograph of the building was displayed.",
        "In the second mode the user typed in the name or function of the building (for example 'Llandinam Building' or 'Earth Sciences') a map Was then displayed of the campus and subsequent maps, each displayed after a mouse click zoomed the user in to the building requested (see Jacobson and Kitchin, in press.)",
        "As such, ArcView was effectively reduced to a point-and-click hypermedia system.",
        "Users of the system expressed great interest and excitement asking can you do this for the town centre'; 'Now I can experience places I would never visit'.",
        "Due to the 'simplicity' of the final slimmed down version of ArcView and to allow optimum access and usability it was decided to continue with the project using the World Wide Web environment.",
        "A series of hypermap World Wide Web pages were built allowing the user to navigate between low vision maps and spoken textual screens.",
        "The interface utilised large font hypertext mark-up language (HTML), and at the bottom right the screen magnifying software.",

        "The touch pad can be attached to a monitor so a user with limited vision is able to view the screen, or used at tabletop level where a totally blind individual is able to scan the pad with their fingertips.",
        "Spatial information is presented as an auditory map.",
        "Areas of the touch pad are overlain with sound, when the map users finger enters the designated area the sound is played.",
        "By touching areas of the pad users were able to determine the size and shape of a map feature by the change in sound.",
        "A collection of sounds are used to represent map information usually conveyed by visual symbols (text, color, line style, shape etc.).",
        "An off-line World Wide Web site is being built which utilizes interlinking auditory maps that can be traversed solely by sound and touch.",
        "As the user's finger is dragged across the touch pad, the system 'talks', playing audio files which are triggered by the position of the user's finger.",
        "By the use of spoken audio, verbal landmarks, environmental audio (such as traffic noise for a road) and auditory icons (earcons - Blattner et at.,1989) to denote specific events like the edge of a map, a link to further maps, or for the user to press for more information, an audio-tactile hypermedia is constructed conveying cartographic information.",
        "Rather than direct manipulation of a tactile surface, such as pressing on the tactile maps in NOMAD, this system uses a touch pad.",
        "Therefore the user has no direct cutaneous stimulus from tactile relief.",
        "The encoding from the audio-tactile stimulus meant that map",
        "information is built up from kinaesthetic sensing of movement across the, pad, sensing of the distance traversed across the pad, proprioceptive sensing of the location of the fingers and location information obtained by referencing with the hands to the outside frame of the touch pad.",

        "As each map loads, a verbal overview describing the map is played.",

        "Figure 1(a) displays the simple user interface for the auditory hypermap system.",
        "As the map reader's finger moves across the touch pad and over the \"SOUTH\" bar the audio message \"Press to go south\" is played.",
        "Once this part of the touchpad is pressed the central area is filled with an auditory map to the south of the previous one.",
