        "The automatic identification of discourse segments and discourse markers in unrestricted texts is crucial for solving many outstanding problems in natural language processing, which range from syntactic and semantic analysis, to anaphora resolution and text summarization.",
        "Most of the algorithmic research in discourse segmentation focused on segments of coarse granularity (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hearst, 1997; Yaari, 1997).",
        "These segments were defined intentionally in terms of Grosz and Sidner's theory (1986) or in terms of an intuitive notion of \"topic\".",
        "However, in case of applications such as anaphora resolution, discourse parsing, and text summarization, even sentences might prove to be too large discourse segments.",
        "For example, if we are to derive the discourse structure of texts using an RSTlike representation (Mann and Thompson, 1988), we will need to determine the elementary textual units that contribute rhetorically to the understanding of those texts; usually, these units are clause-like units.",
        "Also, if we want to select the most important parts of a text, sentences might prove again to be too large segments (Marcu, 1997a; Teufel and Moens, 1998): in some cases, only one of the clauses that make up a sentence should be selected for summarization.",
        "In this paper, I present a surface-based algorithm that uses cue phrases (connectives) in order to determine not only the elementary textual units of text but also the phrases that have a discourse function.",
        "The algorithm is empirically grounded in an extensive corpus analysis of cue phrases and is consistent with the psycholinguistic position advocated by Caron (1997, p. 70).",
        "Caron argues that rather than conveying information about states of things, connectives can be conceived as procedural instructions for constructing a semantic representation\".",
        "Among the three procedural functions of segmentation, integration, and inference that are used by Noordrnan and Vonk (1997) in order to study the role of connectives, I will concentrate here primarily on the first)"

        "I used previous work on coherence and cohesion to create an initial set of more than 450 potential discourse markers (cue phrases).",

        "I then used an automatic procedure that extracted from the Brown corpus a random set of text fragments that each contained that cue.",
        "On average, I selected approximately 17 text fragments per cue phrase, having few texts for the cue phrases that do not occur very often in the corpus and up to 60 for cue phrases, such as and, that I considered to be highly ambiguous.",

        "Whenever a cue phrase is detected, the shallow analyzer executes an action from a predetermined set, whose effect is one of the following: create an elementary textual unit boundary in the input text stream; or set a flag.",
        "Later, if certain conditions are satisfied, the flag setting may lead to the creation of a textual unit boundary.",
        "Since a discussion of the actions is meaningless in isolation, I will provide it in conjunction with the clause-like unit boundary and marker-identification algorithm.",

        "Hence, the algorithm searches for the first closed parenthesis, dash, or comma, ignoring all other markers on the way.",
        "Obviously, this implementation does not assign a discourse usage to discourse markers that are used within a span that is parenthetic.",
        "However, this choice is consistent with the decision discussed in section 3,2, to assign parenthetical information no elementary textual unit status.",
        "Because of this.",
        "the text shown in italics in text (7), for example, is treated as a single parenthetical unit, which is subordinated to \"Yet, even on the summer pole, temperatures never warm enough to melt frozen water\".",
        "In dealing with parenthetical units, the algorithm avoids setting boundaries in cases in which the first comma that comes after a COMMA_PAREN marker is immediately followed by an or or and.",

        "Usually, the discourse role of the cue phrases and and or is ignored because the surface-form algorithm that we propose is unable to distinguish accurately enough between their discourse and sentential usages.",
        "However, lines 8-9 of the algorithm concern cases in which their discourse function can be unambiguously determined.",

        "If a discourse marker is found that immediately follows the occurrence of an and (or an or) and if the left boundary of the elementary unit under consideration is found to the left of the and (or the or), a new elementary unit is identified whose right boundary is just before the and (or the or).",
        "In such a case the and (or the or) is considered to have a discourse function as well, so the flag has_discourse function is set to \"yes\".",
        "If any of the complex conditions in lines 3, 5, or 8 in figure 1 is satisfied, the algorithm not only inserts textual boundaries as discussed above, but it also resets the \"status\" variable to NIL.",
        "Lines 10-19 of the algorithm concern the cases in which the \"status\" variable is NIL If the type of the marker is DUAL, the determination of the textual unit boundaries depends on the marker under scrutiny being adjacent to the marker that precedes it.",
        "If it is, the \"status\" variable is set such that the algorithm will act as in the case of a marker of type COMMA.",
        "If the marker under scrutiny is not adjacent to the marker that immediately preceded it, a textual unit boundary is identified.",
        "This implementation will modify, for example, the variable \"status\" to COMMA when processing the marker although in example (10), but only insert a textual unit boundary when processing the same marker in example (11).",
