        "Within Rhetorical Structure Theory (RsT) (Mann and Thompson 1986, 1988), the discourse structure of a text is represented by means of a hierarchical tree diagram in which contiguous text spans are related by labeled relations.",
        "Hierarchical structure results from the fact that each text span in a labeled relation may itself have a complex internal discourse structure.",
        "Traditionally, human analysts have constructed RST analyses for texts by employing tacit, subjective, intuitive judgments.",
        "RASTA (Corston-Oliver 1998a, 1998b), a discourse analysis component within the Microsoft English Grammar, automatically produces RST analyses of texts.",
        "To do so, it proceeds in three stages.",
        "In the first stage, RASTA identifies the clauses that function as terminal nodes in an RST analysis.",
        "In the second stage, RASTA examines all possible pairs of terminal nodes to determine which discourse relation, if any, might hold between the two nodes.",
        "In the third stage, RASTA combines the terminal nodes according to the discourse relations that it hypothesized to form RST analyses of a complete text.",
        "This paper discusses the second stage of processing, during which RASTA identifies discourse relations.",
        "Whereas introspection is a viable strategy for human analysts, a computational discourse analysis system like RASTA requires explicit methods for identifying discourse relations.",
        "This paper therefore describes (section 2) the kinds of linguistic evidence that RASTA considers in positing discourse structure.",
        "Intuitively, cues to discourse relations are not all equally compelling.",
        "This intuition is reflected in the use of heuristic scores (section 3) to measure the plausibility of a relation.",
        "Section 5 describes in detail the cues used to identify the SEQUENCE relation and gives a worked example.",
        "For a more complete description of the workings of RASTA, the reader is referred to Corston-Oliver (1998b).",
        "The Microsoft English Grammar (MEG) is a broad-coverage grammar of English that performs a morphological analysis, a conventional syntactic constituent analysis and a logical form analysis (involving the normalization of syntactic alternations to yield a representation with the flavor of a predicate representation).",
        "Functional roles such as subject and object are identified and anaphoric references are resolved during linguistic analysis.",
        "To date, I have focused on the text of Encarta 96 (Microsoft Corporation 1995, henceforth Encarta), a general purpose electronic encyclopedia whose articles exhibit a variety of complex discourse structures.",

        "In the computational discourse analysis literature, there are three strands concerning the identification of rhetorical relations.",
        "The first strand (Knott and Dale 1995; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Marcu 1997; Ono et al.",
        "1994; Sanders 1992; Sanders et al.",
        "1992, 1993; Sanders and van Wijk 1996; Sumita et al.",
        "1992) concerns the identification of rhetorical relations by fairly superficial means.",
        "Typically simple pattern matching is used to identify cue phrases.",
        "These cue phrases are then assumed to be in a one-to",
        "one relationship to rhetorical relations.",
        "The second strand (Fukumoto and Tsujii 1994; Hobbs 1979), in contrast to the first strand, eschews an examination of the form of a text in favor of reasoning with more abstract representations such as predicate representations of linguistic content and axiomatic representations of world knowledge.",
        "The third strand concerns programmatic descriptions of how a computational discourse analysis might proceed (Polanyi 1988; Wu and Lytinen 1990), with no specific details about how discourse relations might be identified.",
        "RASTA identifies rhetorical relations by directly examining a text, and is therefore most closely aligned with the first of these three strands.",
        "Like previous work in this vein, ,RASTA.",
        "considers cue phrases to be a useful indicator of rhetorical relations (section 2.3).",
        "However, RASTA goes beyond a simple examination of cue phrases and considers such linguistic evidence as clausal status (section 2.1), anaphora, deixis and referential continuity (section 2.2) and tense, aspect, and polarity (section 5).",
        "Traditionally, RST analysts have been averse to tying their analyses of discourse structure to specific elements of linguistic form.",
        "The descriptions of rhetorical relations in Mann and Thompson (1986, 1988), for example, studiously avoid all mention of the correlates of discourse structure.",
        "This aversion is apparently intended to avoid \"naive mono-functionalism\", i.e. the overly-simplistic assumption of a one-to-one mapping between linguistic form and rhetorical structure.",
        "This laudable concern is accompanied by a general pessimism.",
        "For example, Mann and Thompson (1986:71-72) note that \"we do not believe that there are undiscovered signal forms, and we do not believe that text form can ever provide a definitive basis for describing how relational propositions can be discerned.\"",
        "Instead of looking for simple one-to-one mappings between linguistic form and discourse structure, RASTA considers a number of small cues that stand in many-to-many relations to rhetorical relations.",
        "By allowing these minor cues to converge in identifying discourse relations, the prospects for identifying rhetorical relations appear rosy, as this paper demonstrates."

        "This proposal motivates the most important discriminator of rhetorical relations employed by RASTA.",
        "Hypotactic clause combining, identified by the syntactic analysis performed by MEG, always suggests an asymmetric RST relation in which the matrix clause is posited to be the nucleus and the subordinate clause to be the satellite.",
        "Paratactic clause combining, however, may correspond to either a symmetric or an asymmetric RST relation.",
        "In rare cases, this correlation between clausal status and rhetorical status is the only clue to discourse structure that RASTA is able to identify, i.e. having correctly identified a hypotactic relationship, RASTA is unable to identify a specific corresponding asymmetric rhetorical relation.",
        "In such cases, RASTA proposes an asymmetric relationship which it then labels with a question mark, as illustrated in Figure 1.",

        "On the other hand, considerations of computational efficiency lead us to desire a small set of relations, since as the number of possible discourse relations increases, the number of possible discourse trees to be considered increases exponentially; the smaller the set of hypothesized relations, the more quickly the algorithm for constructing RST trees (Corston-Oliver 1998a, 1998b) can test all possibilities.",
        "RASTA resolves this tension by distinguishing two kinds of evidence.",
        "The first kind of evidence is the set of necessary criteria – the conditions that simply must be met before RASTA is even willing to \"consider\" a given discourse relation.",
