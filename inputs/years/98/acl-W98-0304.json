        "(While operating the toaster, do not cover the bread slots.)",
        "In both cases, the order of events as recounted in the text does not correspond to their order of oc-curence: In example (1), nachdem (after) marks the event denoted in the second clause as temporally anterior to the one denoted in the first clause.",
        "In example (2), wdhrend (while) marks both events as cotemporal.",
        "Without a temporal marker, the order of events would not be obvious.",
        "Selecting an appropriate discourse marker for a given temporal relation is by no means a straightforward matter, though.",
        "First, one and the same temporal relation is verbalized differently depending on the syntactic and lexical properties of the clauses it conjoins.",
        "In German, the language we consider, such properties are, among others, tense, aspect, and syntactic structure.",
        "Interdependencies occur when two temporal events are realized in the same sentence; we will therefore restrict the study of German temporal markers to subordinating conjunctions and prepositions.",
        "Second, temporal discourse markers can even overwrite the temporal relations indicated by other linguistic means like tense and aspect, as noted by researchers who work in the analysis of temporal markers (e.g. Hitzeman et al.",
        "1995).",
        "In a nutshell, when aiming at selecting an appropriate temporal marker in text generation one needs a representation of temporal markers that enables marker choice and other sentence level decisions (such as tense and aspect selection) to mutually constrain each other.",
        "In this paper, we take up the idea suggested in Grote and Stede (1998) of a discourse marker lexicon as a declarative resource at the sentence planning stage.",
        "We demonstrate how such a lexicon for temporal markers can be employed in text generation to produce different verbalizations of the same underlying temporal organization depending on other generation decisions.",

        "Temporal markers have neither received much attention in NLG, nor has a principled account of marker selection as such been introduced.",
        "In this paper we presented a general framework for representing German temporal markers for generation purposes.",
        "We identified some of the features required to describe applicability conditions, constraints and preferences, and proposed a declarative lexical resource that makes it possible to treat temporal markers and other linguistic means as mutual constraints at the sentence planning stage.",
        "Now, we need to examine individual temporal markers more closely and incorporate the temporal marker lexicon into a text generation system.",
        "For the purpose of this paper, we have assumed that temporal relations are always explicitly sig-nalled, and thus limited our study to marker selection.",
        "Marker occurrence, however, is an important issue.",
        "First, Hitzeman et al.",
        "(1995) argue that there exist temporal defaults of the kind \"An event will occur just after a preceding event\"; this renders the introduction of explicit markers superfluous.",
        "Second, we have only assumed pairs of timestamped expressions, but have ignored that they usually occur in a larger discourse situation where other kinds of coherence relations might hold between events.",
        "For instance, all causal coherence relations have some temporal implicature; still, one does not want a temporal marker to signal a VOLITIONAL-CAUSE, even though cause and effect are temporally related.",
        "Finally, future work needs to address the interaction of marker choice and temporal adverbs, as these are the means to realize the simple/progressive distinction in German.",
        "Acknowledgement Thanks to Manfred Stede and two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper."
