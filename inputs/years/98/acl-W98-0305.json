        "In this paper, I would like to address a methodological question that starts from the following observation: There is a growing number of corpus studies in the area of the use of coherence relations and discourse markers in natural texts.",
        "Most of these studies try to establish a relationship between the coherence relations found in the text and the discourse markers used to signal them linguistically, very often inter-clausal connectives (Degand 1996, 1998; Grote, Lenke & Stede 1997; Knott 1996; Mann & Thompson 1992; Oversteegen 1997; Pit, Pander Maat & Sanders 1997; Pander Maat & Sanders 1995, Sanders 1997).",
        "However, the results of these studies are hardly ever straightforward to compare.",
        "The main reason for this is that the methods used to classify both the coherence relations and their linguistic markers are very often divergent and in the best cases only partially overlapping.",
        "So, in order to enable comparison of the different studies, there is a need for clear and explicit classification criteria.",
        "In this paper, I will try to set out a number of such (operationalisable) elements that could function as tools in the categorisation task.",
        "The goal will be reached if the categorisation criteria are formulated in such an explicit way that they can be applied by different analysts to all kinds of natural texts."

        "A classical approach to coherence relations is to classify them into relational or discourse domains: semantic vs. pragmatic (van Dijk 1979; Sanders 1992: Pander Maat & Sanders 1995), content vs. epistemic vs. speech-act (S weetser 1990), external vs. internal (Halliday & Hasan 1985, Martin 1992).",
        "subject matter vs. presentational (Mann & Thompson 1988), ideational vs. interpersonal vs. textual (Degand 1996, Maier & Hovy 1993), ideational vs. rhetorical vs. sequential (Redeker 1991).",
        "These classifications all account for the fact that there are different types of coherence relations that exist at several \"levels\", \"strata\", \"planes\" or \"domains.\" of the discourse.",
        "It is striking to note that there is a great amount of agreement between the authors with respect to the different general types of coherence relations.",
        "They can be grossly characterised as follows:",
        "• Ideational / semantic / content external / subject matter relations establish a link between discourse units that denote states of affairs in the world described in the discourse.",
        "Examples are : cause, sequence, contrast, etc.",
        "• Interpersonal / pragmatic / internal / presentational / rhetorical relations establish a link between the illocutionary meaning of one of the discourse units with the locutionary meaning of the other.",
        "Examples are: * Senior research assistant at the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (F.N.R.S.",
        ").",
        "justification, motivation, evidence, conclusion, etc.",
        "Furthermore, a distinction can be made between (i) epistemic (knowledge of a fact leads to conclusion of a belief), and (ii) speech-act relations (a fact leads to the utterance of a speech-act).",
        "• Textual / sequential relations establish a",
        "sequential, text organising relation between ideationally and interpersonally only loosely or indirectly related adjacent discourse segments.",
        "Examples are: list, joint, etc.",
        "or any other ideational or interpersonal relations when they are used as comment, digression, excursus, etc.",
        "While the characterisation of these relational domains is general enough so as to account for all different kinds of discourse structures, this generality poses a number of problems as soon as one starts to work with natural texts.",
        "Most of the time there is agreement on prototypical examples (very often built-up examples for purposes of illustration), but in actual text analysis one gets rapidly confronted with an important number of ambiguous cases.",
        "That is, when one tries to establish what type of coherence relations are present in the text, it becomes rapidly impossible to classify found relations on the basis of these definitions alone.",
        "Different elements may account for these problems: (i) coherence relations are not always marked linguistically, (ii) there is no one to one mapping between coherence relation and linguistic discourse marker, and (iii) there is no general consensus on the type of linguistic constructions that may function as discourse markers (connectives, prepositions, adverbials, intonation patterns, cue phrases, etc.).",
        "In the literature, connectives are generally considered to be prototypical linguistic markers of coherence relations.",
        "In this paper, I will then concentrate on the problems that arise when one tries to relate to each other the discourse domains as described above, the coherence relations and the connectives that may signal these coherence relations.",
        "This will be exemplified on the hand of causal constructions.",
        "2 From connective to coherence relation While it is clear that coherence relations are not always signalled linguistically, and that they may be signalled by other linguistic means than connectives, it seems plausible to accept that inter-clausal connectives always mark (at least) a coherence relation.",
        "As a matter of fact, this is what appeared from my corpus analyses : any causal connective linking two (minimally propositional) segments always functioned as a linguistic marker of a coherence relation.",
        "This means that it is justified to use a bottom-up approach to study coherence relations.",
        "The question to answer then is: How does one know what type of coherence relation is signalled by the connective?",
        "And corollary to this: In what discourse domain is the connective used?",
        "Answering these types of questions implies to combine both a top-down approach in which broad general semantic categories are defined with a bottom-up approach in which the meaning and function of a number of linguistic markers, such as connectives, are described.",
        "The combination of these two approaches should (i) guarantee the linguistic validity of the discourse domains and the coherence relations and (ii) help to reach a parsimonious and organised classification of the connectives that function as linguistic markers of these higher-level semantic categories.",
        "Working with more than one language in this context may be helpful to reveal the degree of idiosyncrasy of the different types and categories.",
        "Since I will restrict my investigations here to the coherence relations that are linguistically marked by connectives, I will only address one of the three above mentioned problems.",
        "Namely, the observation that there is no one to one mapping between coherence relation and discourse marker.",
        "This entails that a coherence relation is not always marked by the same connective, and that a given connective does not always signal the same coherence relation.",
        "For example, in the causal domain, the ideational relation NON-VOLITIONAL CAUSE may be marked by the Dutch connectives omdat and doordat (because').",
        "At the same time, the connective want can signal the coherence relations VOLITIONAL CAUSE, NON-VOLITIONAL CAUSE, and CLAIM-ARGUMENT, in either of the ideational or interpersonal discourse domains.",
        "From what has been mentioned so far it should be clear that there is a need to disambiguate the (sometimes complex) relationship between coherence relations and their surface cues.",
        "Objective and explicit methods are needed that operationalise the type of above-mentioned definitions.",
        "Different methods that are used in the field will pass the review, including (i) the meaning of the connective itself, (ii) the substitution test.",
        "(iii) the paraphrase test, (iv) the underlying meaning of the relation, and (v) the role of other linguistic markers such as perspective indicators.",
        "In my opinion, the combination of different tests together with corpus analyses opens up interesting perspectives with respect to the usability and applicability of these methods in real field work."

        "In agreement with the functional approach to language I consider that different surface cues reflect different functions and meanings.",

        "While this substitution test can bring us closer to a linguistically motivated classification of connectives because it groups together surface cues that are close in meaning, the main problem is that the whole classification is based on the analysts' judgement.",

        "Of course, the analyst's intuition is still the ultimate criterion to classify the connective as expressing one or another meaning, but the paraphrase test makes the different interpretations explicit, so it helps the analyst to systematically check his/her intuitions.",
