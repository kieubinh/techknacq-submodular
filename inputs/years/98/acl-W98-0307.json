      "text": [
        "We are interested in a formal description of the document structure of scientific articles from different disciplines.",
        "Such a description could be of practical use for many applications in document management; our specific motivation for detecting document structure is quality improvement in automatic abstracting.",
        "Researchers in the field of automatic abstracting largely agree that it is currently not technically feasible to create automatic abstracts based on full text understanding (Sparck Jones 1994).",
        "As a result, many researchers have turned to sentence extraction (Kupieu, Pedersen, & Chen 1995; Brandow, Mitze, & Rau 1995; Hovy & Lin 1997).",
        "Sentence extraction, which does not involve any deep analysis, has the huge advantage of being robust with respect to individual writing style, discipline and text type (genre).",
        "Instead of producing abstracts, this results produces only extracts: document surrogates consisting of a number of sentences selected verbatim from the original text.",
        "We consider a concrete document retrieval (DR.) scenario in which a researcher wants to select one or more scientific articles from a large scientific database (or even from the Internet) for further inspection.",
        "The main task for the searcher is relevance decision for each paper: she needs to decide whether or not to spend more time on a paper (read or skim-read it), depending on how useful it presumably is to her current information needs.",
        "Traditional sentence extracts can be used as rough-and-ready relevance indicators for this task, but they are not doing a great job at representing the contents of the original document: searchers often get the wrong idea about what the text is about.",
        "Much of this has to do with the fact that extracts are typically incoherent texts, consisting of potentially unrelated sentences which have been taken out of their context.",
        "Crucially, extracts have no handle at revealing the text's logical and semantic organisation.",
        "More sophisticated, user-tailored abstracts could help the searcher make a fast, informed relevance decision by taking factors like the searcher's expertise and current information need into account.",
        "If the searcher is dealing with research she knows well, her information needs might be quite concrete: during the process of writing her own paper she might want to find research which supports her own claims, find out if there are contradictory results to hers in the literature, or compare her results to those of researchers using a similar methodology.",
        "A different information need arises when she wants to gain an overview of a new research area â€“ as an only \"partially informed user\" in this field (Kircz 1991) she will need to find out about specific research goals.",
        "the names of the researchers who have contributed the main research ideas in a given time period, along with information of methodology and results in this research field.",
        "There are new functions these abstracts could fulfil.",
        "In order to make an informed relevance decision, the searcher needs to judge differences and similarities between papers, e.g. how a given paper relates to similar papers with respect to research goals or methodology, so that she can place the research described in a given paper in the larger picture of the field, a function we call navigation between research articles.",
        "A similar operation is navigation within a paper, which supports searchers in non-linear reading and allows them to find relevant information faster, e.g. numerical results.",
        "We believe that a document surrogate that aims at supporting such functions should characterize research articles in terms of the problems, research tasks and",
        "solutions/methodology presented in the specific paper, but it should also represent other researchers problems, research tasks and solutions mentioned in the paper.",
        "Our long-term goal is to automatically reconstruct this problem-solution structure from unrestricted text for the searcher in the form of a problem-structured abstract.",
        "But how can we find problems, research questions, research tasks and solutions in text without fully understanding the text?",
        "We take sentence extraction as a starting point due to its inherent robustness.",
        "Using additional information about each sentence, viz, their rhetorical status with respect to the entire paper, we are in a better position to perform shallow, but guided information extraction, in order to find the information units we are interested in In the next section we introduce the level of document structure we are talking about, and the kind of meta-comments we employ in discovering it.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we report on ongoing work on automatically filtering meta-comments from annotated and unannota.ted text.",
        "Finding meta-comments in text is an attractive task because it would allow for the automatic adaptation of sytems using such phrases to new domains.",
        "2 Discourse structure and argumentation in scientific articles Discourse linguistic theory suggests that texts serving a common purpose among a community of users eventually take on a predictable structure of presentation (Kintscla & van Dijk 1978) - and scientific articles certainly serve a well-defined communicative purpose: they \"present, retell and refer to the results of specific research\" (Salager-Meyer 1992).",
        "Particularly in the life and experimental sciences, a rigid building plan for research articles has evolved over the years, where rhetorical divisions tend to be very clearly marked in section headers.",
        "Prototypical rhetorical divisions include Introduction, Purpose, Experimental Design, Results, Discussion, Conclusions.",
        "One of the reasons for this rigidly-defined structure seems to be that the scientific community in these fields has more or less agreed on how to do research: methodologies and evaluation methods are long-lived research entities that do not change often.",
        "One of the corpora we are using is a good example of such texts.",
        "It consists of 129 articles in cardiology, taken from the American Heart Journal, which have a fixed structure with respect to rhetorical divisions and section headers.",
        "The other corpus, in contrast, consisting of 123 (mostly conference) articles in computational linguistics (CL), displays an heterogeneous mixture of methodologies and traditions of presentation one would expect in an interdisciplinary field.",
        "Most of the articles cover more than one single discipline, but as a rough estimate one can say that about 45% of the articles in the collection are predominantly technical in style, describing implementations (i.e. engineering solutions); about 25% report on research in theoretical linguistics, with an argumentative tenet; the remaining 30% are empirical (psycholinguistic or psychological experiments or corpus studies).",
        "Even though most of the articles have an introduction and conclusions (sometimes occurring under headers with different names), and almost all of them cite previous work, the presentation of the problem and the methodology/solution are idiosyncratic and depend on individual writing style.",
        "Very few of the headers in the computational linguistics articles correspond to prototypical rhetorical divisions; the rest contain content specific terminology (cf.",
        "Figure 1 which compares relative frequencies of headers for the two corpora).",
        "Because the type of research reported in the computational linguistics corpus differs so much, the description of document structure we were looking for had to be flexible enough to generalize over differences in presentation, yet formal enough for the extraction of the information units which are useful for automatic abstracts.",
        "We base our model of argumentation in scientific articles on Swales' (1990) CARS model (\"Create a Research Space\").",
        "Swales' claim is that the main communicative goal of an author of a research article is to convince readers (potential reviewers) that the research described in the paper constitutes an actual contribution to science, in order to have the paper reviewed positively and thus published; this is the case whether or not the paper tries to give the impression that it reports research in an objective, disinterested way.",
        "In order to successfully present their case, authors argue in a goal-directed and prototypical way about problem-solving activities â€“ their own and other researchers'.",
        "Swales identified prototypical rhetorical building plans of introduction sections, along with linguistics surface cues that signal rhetorical moves.",
        "Examples for rhetorical",
        "moves include the claim that the paper addresses a new problem or, if it is a well-known problem, then the presented solution has to be better than that of other researchers.",
        "A first analysis of the corpora confirmed many of the rhetorical building blocks suggested by Swales.",
        "We adapted Swales' scheme to the one shown in Figure 8 (at the end of this paper).",
        "In the medical corpus, almost all of the moves we found were of type I (Explicit mention); the rigid document structure seems to have replaced much of the \"argument about problem-solving activities\" (types II-V) for which we found ample evidence in the computational linguistics corpus.",
        "We are interested in identifying these moves automatically and shallowly in text, and we believe that this is technically feasible, because the stereotypical, predictable overall structure of the argument can be exploited in doing so."

        "They cover the activities of reporting about research (reporting and presenting verbs), the problem-solving process (problems, solutions, tasks); they also include other semantic links like necessity, causality and contrast.",
        "Due to explicit or implicit argumentation, many of these strings are evaluative (\"efficBent, elegant, innovative, insight-ful\" vs. 'imposszble, inadequate, inconclusive, insufficient\").",
        "We call them meta-comments because they talk about information units, as opposed to being subject matter (scientific content).",

        "Lexical seeds are words which are semantically related to the activities of reporting, problem-solving, argument-ing or evaluating, or expressions of deixis ( \"we... \") or other textual cues (e.g. literature references in text were marked up using the symbol [REF], which is a signal for mentions of other researchers' solutions, tasks or problems).",

        "We also compiled and counted n-grams for the 948 computational linguistics target sentences, to see how similar these phrases from the annotated parts were to the filtered or unfiltered bigrams from the entire corpus.",

        "After filtering, the meta-comments on the lists have two properties: (a) they are frequent (b) they contain lexical items that could be related to argumentation about problems, research tasks, solutions â€“ in the computational linguistics corpus, these conditions seem to be enough to produce expressions that are good candidates for meta-comments.",
