        "In many cases, 1ST (Mann & Thomson 1988) is interpreted or used in such a way that discourse relations hold only between sentences or clauses, i.e. the leaves of the rhetorical tree structure of a text correspond to sentences or clauses.",
        "This interpretation of RST has already been cr,:icized (Smedt et al.",
        "1996) and this paper goes in this line.",
        "In general, a discourse relation can be realized in many different ways.",
        "In addition to traditional ways such as a text made up of two sentences with or without a cue phrase (Ted hammered the metal.",
        "(Therefore), it is flat), there exist other ways such as a single sentence, e.g. a \"resultative construction (Ted hammered the metal fiat) or an \"operator verb construction\" Ted's hammering the metal caused it to be flaz).",
        "The question arises: given the numerous and heterogeneous set of possible linguistic realizations, how can these possible realizations be expressed in a linguistically motivated manner so that a natural language processing system can make use of this knowledge?",
        "This paper presents a uniform framework for expressing the linguistic knowledge needed to relate discourse relations to linguistic realizations.",
        "In addition, it sketches how such a representation can be used during the linguistic planning stage of text generation and presents a lexicalized text generation system designed in the lines of a lexicalized grammar for sentence analysis.",
        "In such a system, lexical entries give semantic and syntactic information in a well defined structure.",
        "Therefore, the generation process for linguistic choices relies mainly upon a unique operation: lexicalization, i.e. choice of a lexical item with its semantic and syntactic structure to express a concept."
