        "One specific cue is a region of low pitch.",
        "Behavior of Japanese listeners can be modeled with the following rule: Upon detection of",
        "a) a region of pitch less than the 28th-percentile pitch level and b) continuing for at least 110ms,",
        "Thanks to Wataru Tsukahara, Dan Jurafsky.",

        "We have tested the predictions of the above rule against a corpus of casual, mostly friendly Japanese conversations between mostly students (80 minutes total).",

        "the rule predicted 496. using a 300 ms tolerance) and an accuracy of 34C, 1447 predictions, 496 were correct).",
        "This did better than a rule which makes predictions at random (while obeying clauses c d, and e), both on average (Table 1), and for most speakers in most conversations: in 34 cases out of 36 (2 sides times 18 conversations) the figure of merit (namely the product of coverage and accuracy) was higher for the low pitch rule.",
        "Analysis of the false predictions for Japanese suggests that roughly half are due to inter-speaker differences in back-channel behavior: this is the source of the eavesdropping estimate.",
        "Similar results were obtained for a corpus of 68 minutes of English conversation data for the English rule (Table 2), although the accuracy was much lower, suggesting that in English factors other than low pitch are relatively more important than in Japanese."

        "The low pitch region is often followed by silence at the end of a speaker's utterance.",
        "The energy drop that marks the start of this silence is, counter-intuitively, not much of a cue for back-channel feedback, providing little or no information beyond that provided by the low pitch cue, as seen in the tables (results are for a rule which predicts a back-channel in response to 150ms of silence, subject to clauses c, d. and e of the corresponding low pitch rule).",
        "This also implies that the low pitch region is often a valid cue even when it appears in the middle of an utterance.",
        "The low pitch region occasionally segues into a rise in intonation (uptalk).",
        "This seems to turn an invitation for feedback into a demand for it.",
