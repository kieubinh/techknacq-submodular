        "In the past few years, researchers interested in accounting for how elements combine in a discourse, have taken to using the adjoining operation found in Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Gardent, 1994; Gardent, 1997; Polanyi and van den Berg, 1996; Schilder, 1997; van den Berg, 1996; Webber, 1991).",
        "More recently, Cristea and Webber (1997) have argued that a Tree-Adjoining Grammar for discourse would also need the substitution operation found in a lexicalized TAG (Schabes, 1990).",
        "Here we move further and explore a fully lexicalized TAG for discourse, allowing us to examine how the insights of lexicalized grammars - that the basic elements of a clause are not simply words, but structures that reflect a word's role and syntactic/semantic scope - carry over to discourse.",
        "We show how this suggests explanations for such phenomena as the following:",
        "• that arguments of a coherence relation can be stretched \"long distance\" by intervening material; • that multiple discourse cues can appear in a single sentence or even a single clause; • that when discourse cues appear in the middle of clauses, they contribute to coherence in more specific ways; • that coherence relations can vary in how and .",
        "when they are realized lexically.",
        "One way of understanding the current work is that it extrapolates from lexically-based views of how structure and meaning are associated within a sentence to how aspects of discourse structure and meaning might be associated in similar ways.",
        "While the idea that discourse-level mechanisms might resemble intra-sentential mechanisms has long been an undercurrent within discourse research, we have come to believe that the framework of lexica.lized grammar can be effecti':ely used to demonstrate the validity of this intuition.",
        "While we present the ideas in terms of one well-known formalism - Lexicalized TAG - other lexicalized formalisms such as CCG (Steedman.",
        "1996b) might prove equally useful for expressing the same theoretical insights and implementing them for discourse generation and/or inter-pre z ation, A superficial reading of the current proposal might suggest that it is-merely a simple embedding of RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988) in TAG.",
        "That would be incorrect.",
        "First, the primary feature of a fully lexicalized TAG is that each elementary tree in the grammar has an anchor that indexes the tree and defines its syntactic/semantic scope.",
        "Here, we posit a set of initial (non-recursive) trees, whose anchor is a discourse cue.",
        "Structurally, some initial trees resemble the nucleus-satellite structures of RST, and some, its joint schema.",
        "But the resemblence is only superficial, as initial trees have a purely compositional semantics that makes no assumptions about what the speaker is trying to do.1 Secondly, there is a single auxthary tree whose semantics corresponds simply to continuing the description conveyed by the structure to which it is adjoined.",
        "Any additional inferences that a listener draws from the resulting adjacency are defeasible,",
        "and may be cancelled or corrected by material in the subsequent discourse.",
        "Our proposal thus factors the combinability of elementary discourse clauses from inferences that may then be drawn, thus providing a tool for sorting out different semantic processes in discourse, instead of lumping them into a single category.",
        "Many of these inferences have been given the status of discourse relations in RST.",
        "However, we argue in Section 2.3 that one can gain from distinguishing what is derived compositionally from what is derived inferentially.",
        "Thirdly, there are auxiliary trees for other discourse cues, that can adjoin to either initial trees or auxiliary trees.",
        "These discourse cues contribute meaning (and coherence) through their presuppositions or assertions or both.",
        "They can thereby serve to constrain the range of inferences that a listener might draw when a description is extended, limiting them to ones compatible with the contribution of the discourse cue.",
        "Similarly, a discourse cue adjoined to an initial tree can either further specify the compositional meaning of the related units or constrain how that initial tree can be used in extending another description.",
        "This will explain how several discourse cues can appear in the same sentence or even the same clause, each contributing to either the compositional or presu.ppositional semantics of the discourse (Section 2.2).",
        "This is still a \"work in progress\", with many open questions.",
        "However, it may still pique the interest of two historically distinct groups: it may stimulate people working on syntax to look beyond the clause for phenomena familiar to them within it., while it may help people working on discourse to ground their claims and insights in more traditional varieties of linguistic formalisms."

        "A lexicalized TAG begins with the notion of a lexical anchor, which can have one or more associated tree structures.",
        "For example, the verb likes anchors one tree corresponding to John likes apples, another corresponding to the topicalized construction Apples John likes, and a third corresponding to the passive construction Apples are liked by John.",
        "All in all, there is a tree for each minimal syntactic construction in which likes can appear, all sharing the same predicate-argument structure.",
        "This syntactic/semantic encapsulation is possible because of the extended domain of locality of LTAG.",
        "Trees in such a tree family may differ in being licensed by different states of the discourse (i.e., information structure (Steedman, 1996a)).",
        "A lexicalized TAG contains two kinds of elementary trees: initial (non-recursive) trees that reflect basic functor-argument dependencies and auxiliary trees that introduce recursion and allow elementary trees to be modified and/or elaborated.",
        "In our lexicalized discourse TAG, we have so far found the need to posit only two types of initial tree families (Section 2.1) and two types of auxiliary trees (Section 2.2).",
        "While the resulting grammar is thus very simple – only one type, only binary predicates – it so far appears expressively adequate."

        "Subordinate conjunctions are one major class of discourse cues, and clause-level LTAG already provides an account of subordinate clauses with overt subordinate .conjunctions.",
        "Its \"verb-centric\" account in (XTAG-Group, 1995) appropriately treats subordinate clauses as adjuncts – i.e., auxiliary trees.",
        "However, from a discourse perspective, we treat two clauses connected by a subordinate conjunction as an initial tree whose compositional semantics reflect the subordinate conjunction as predicate (or \"functor\") and the clauses as arguments.",
        "There is an initial tree for each minimal structural pattern of main clause and subordinate clause, including those shown in Figure 1.",
        "All such trees share the same predicate (functor) argument structure.",
        "As in clause-level tree families, each pattern may have different preconditions on its use that reflect the current state of the discourse (i.e., information structure).",
        "For example, it has been noted that a \"when\" clause in initial position presupposes that the situation described therein is in the hearer's discourse model (or can be so accommodated), while a \"when\" clause coming after the main clause is not so constrained.",
        "In Section 3, we discuss reasons for taking the lexical anchors of these initial trees to be feature structures that may correspond to one or more subordinate conjunctions such as \"if\" and \"when\".",
        "Here we just take them to be specific lexical items.",
        "Now one reason for taking something to be an initial tree is that it has local dependencies that can be stretched long-distance.",
        "For example, the dependency between apples and likes in both John likes apples and apples John likes is localized in all the trees for likes.",
        "It can be stretched, however, long-distance as in Apples.",
        "Bill thinks John may like.",
        "In (Cristea and Webbe:' 1997), we have shown that the same long-distance stretching of dependencies occurs with both subordinate clauses (Ex.",
        "1) and parallel constructions (Ex.",
        "2) – e.g.",
        "1. a.",
        "Although John is very generous, b. giving money to whoever asks, c. when you actually need it, d. you'll see that he's a bugger to and.",

        "c. You would just have to ask for it.",
        "d. On the other hand, he's a bugger to find.",
        "Thus here we also posit an initial tree for parallel structures (Figure 1d).",
        "Since there are different ways in which entities are taken to be parallel, we currently assume a different initial tree for contrast (\"on the one hand\" ... \"on the other hand\" ), disjunction (\"either\" ... \"or\" ... ), addition!",
        "\"not only\" ... but also\" ... ), and concession (\"admittedly\" ... \"but\" ... ).",
        "Such trees have a pair of anchors with two main properties.",
        "The first is that their lexical realization seems optional.",
        "In contrastive cases, a medial anchor such as \"on the other hand\" often appears lexicalized without an initial phrase such as \"on the one hand\".",
        "In fact, there are more cases of this in the Brown Corpus than of the two appearing together.",
        "Also optional is the realization of the initial anchor in disjunction (omitting \"either\"), addition (omitting \"not only\"), and concession (omitting \"admittedly\").",
        "But we have recently noted cases where only the initial anchor is realized lexically but not the medial anchor, although this is less common: Not only have they [Rauschenberg's blueprints] survived.",
        "The process of their creation was recorded by Life magazine in April 1931.",
        "(New York Review of Books, 6 November 1997, p.8) The second property is that the medial anchor appears realizable in multiple ways.",
        "Cristea and Webber (1997) report that, of the eleven instances of \"on the one hand\" found in the Brown Corpus, four have their contrasting item cued by something other than \"on the other (hand)\" - including \"but\" and \"at the same time\": 3.",
