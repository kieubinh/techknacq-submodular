        "Cue phrases are words and phrases, such as 'first\", \"and\", \"now\", that connect discourse spans and add structure to the discourse both in text and dialogue.",
        "They signal topic shifts and changes in attentional state (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) as well as expressing the relation between the individual units of discourse (Moore, 1995; ItOsner and Stede.",
        "1992).",
        "In this study, we focus on the former kind of cue phrases, organization cue phrases that signal the structural organization of discourse.",
        "In instruction dialogue, the organization cue phrases play a crucial role in controlling dialogue and making the material easy to understand.",
        "Moreover, in dialogue systems, the user cannot comprehend the structural organization of the dialogue unless the appropriate cue phrases are included in the system's utterances.",
        "Therefore, for dialogue generation, we must identify the determining factors of organization cue phrases and select the cue phrases appropriately.",
        "In previous studies that have investigated the relationship between cue phrases and the types of structural change (e.g. pop, push), the taxonomies of cue phrases have been presented (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Cohen, 1984; Schiffrin, 1987).",
        "These taxonomies are, however, not sufficient for generation because the correspondence between cue phrase and structural change is many-to-many quite often.",
        "For example, \"now\" ,\"and\", and \"next\" are all classified as the category signaling push in attentional state.",
        "Therefore, the indication of structural shifts in dis",
        "course is not sufficient to fully constrain cue phrase selection.",
        "In this study, we reveal what factors affect organization cue phrase selection, and establish more precise selection rules for generating instruction dialogues.",
        "As factors for cue phrase selection, we examine a variety of features concerning discourse structure, task structure, and dialogue context.",
        "The reason that we examine these three factors is as follows.",
        "First, discourse structure is indispensable for selecting cue phrase as claimed in previous studies (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Cohen, 1984; Eugenio et al., 1997).",
        "We examine some features concerning this fact& such as the global structure of discourse and structural shifts in discourse.",
        "Second, while the discourse structure provides information about the preceding discourse, Cawsey (1993) claimed that information about the succeeding discourse (e.g., length and complexity) is also necessary in order to select cue phrases dynamically in dialogue systems.",
        "From this point of view, task structure is expected to be effective because discourse structure strongly reflects task structure in task oriented dialogue (Grosz, 1977; Guindon, 1986).",
        "Finally, in contrast to these structural aspects of dialogue, we think it important to consider sequential contexts of dialogue such as the types of dialogue exchange (Steristrarn, 1994) immediately preceding to the cue phrase.",
        "In this paper, using a machine learning technique, C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "we examine these features in terms of their effectiveness in selecting organization cue phrase and identify the most effective set of learning features.",
        "In addition, we evaluate the accuracy of decision trees obtained using a large corpus.",
        "Our result reveals that, in addition to discourse structure whose effectiveness has already revealed in previous studies, task structure and dialogue context play important roles.",
        "Especially important are the place of the segment in the global structure of the dialogue and the type of the immediately preceding dialogue exchange.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work.",
        "Section 3 mentions the annotation of our dialogue corpus while section 4 details the learning experiment and its results are discussed.",

        "While cue phrases can appear in different places in instruction dialogues, we focus on the organization cue phrases that occur at the beginning of discourse segments referring to goals or direct actions.",
        "This is because such kind of cue phrases have the important function of describing the basic structure of the dialogue.",
        "In a procedural instruction dialogue, the sequence of actions for the procedure is directed step by step.",
        "In terms of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987), it is considered that the basic structure of such kind of discourse is constructed by connecting segments that refer to goals or primitive actions with \"sequence\" relation (ROsner and Stede, 1992; Kosseim and La-palme, 1994).",
        "Therefore, the cue phrases which occur at the beginning of segments that are connected with \"sequence\" relation and refer to goals or direct actions play important roles in signaling the basic structure of the dialogue.",
        "Moreover, such kind of cue phrases are observed very frequently in instruction dialogues.",
        "In their empirical study on the characteristics of task oriented dialogues.",
        "Oviatt and Cohen (1990) reported that, in instruction dialogues on assembling a pump, cue phrases such as \"Okay\", \"now\" and \"next\" occur at the beginning of 98.6% of the new segments that instruct assembly actions in telephone dialogues.",
        "Based on the above, we think it important for dialogue generation to select and set appropriate cue phrases at the beginning of discourse segments that refer to goals or direct actions.",
        "Moser and Moore (1995a) and Moser and Moore (1995b) investigated the relationship between cue placement and selection.",
        "They showed that the cue phrases are selected and distinguished depending on their placement.",
        "Somewhat differently, we tackle the problem of selecting cue phrases that occur at the same place in the segment (at the beginning of the segment).",
        "As indicated in (Eugenio et al., 1997), in terms of natural language generation, cue usage consists of three problems, occurrence: whether or not a cue should be included, placement: where the cue should be placed, and selection: what cue should be used.",
        "We tackle the third problem, the selection of cue phrases.",
        "Our final goal is to establish a strategy for selecting organization cue phrases and apply it in the generation of instruction dialogues.",
        "While the empirical approach of this study is close to that of (Eugenio et al., 1997), they apply a machine learning technique to predicating cue occurrence and placement, not cue phrase selection."

        "This result indicates that all the factors are necessary to predict cue phrases.",
        "The important factors for cue phrase selection are task structure and dialogue context as well as discourse structure, the focus of many earlier studies.",
        "While we identified the six features from the three kinds of factors, by looking at the decision trees created in the learning experiment, we found which features were more important than others in selecting cue phrases.",
        "The features appearing near the root node are more important.",
        "Figure 3 shows the top part of a decision tree obtained from the Simplest model.",

        "This paper reported the results of using a machine learning algorithm for identifying learning features and obtaining decision trees for selecting cue phrases.",
        "It also reported the result of a quantitative evaluation of the decision trees learned.",
        "Learning features concerning three factors, discourse structure, task structure, and dialogue context, were examined.",
        "By carrying out many experiments in which the combinations of learning features were varied, we found the most simple and effective learning feature set.",
        "The accuracy of the best model that uses 6 learning features is about 70%.",
        "The error rate is reduced about 25% from the baseline.",
        "These results support the claims of previous studies that discourse structure influence cue selection.",
        "In addition, it is revealed that task structure and dialogue context are also indispensable factors.",
        "We focus on predicting the cue phrases that occur at the beginning of discourse segments for signaling inter-segment \"sequence\" relation.",
        "Elhadad and McKeown (1990), on the other hand, has presented a model for distinguishing connectives, which link two propositions, using some pragmatic constraints.",
        "In (Moser and Moore, 1995a; Moser and Moore, 1995b), the relationship between placement and selection of cue phrases was investigated using the core:contributor relations among units within a segment (Moser and Moore, 1995a).",
        "Although we discussed only the \"sequence\" relation between the",
        "segments, the methods presented here will be useful in extending our model so as to select other kinds of cue phrases."
