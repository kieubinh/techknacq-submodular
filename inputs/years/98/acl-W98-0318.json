        "In spite of their important quantitative role, discourse particles have so far been neglected in automatic speech processing for two reasons: Firstly it is not clear what they may contribute to the aims of automatic speech processing, and secondly their functions seem to vary so much that it seems difficult to identify the information relevant to such aims.",
        "The approach presented here therefore attempts to provide automatic means to distinguishing the different readings of discourse particles and to filtering out the information which can be useful for speech understanding systems, employing positional information and their role within a dialogue model of the respective domain, two types of information which are especially easy to obtain.",

        "Discourse particles, as for instance German ja, nein, ach, oh, and ahrn, and English well, yes, oh, ah, and uhrn (Schiffrin, 1987), are extremely frequent phenomena of spontaneous spoken language dialogues.",
        "For instance, in informal German human-to-human communication, their frequency ranges between 8.8% and 9.8% (Fischer and Johanntokrax, 1995).",
        "In human-computer interaction, this prominent quantitative role decreases; however, they may still constitute 6.6% of the 150 most frequent words (Fischer and Johanntokrax, 1995).",
        "In spite of their important quantitative role, discourse particles have so far been neglected in automatic speech processing; if they are identified at all, then only in order to eliminate them (O'Shaugnessy, 1993).",
        "Reasons may be firstly that it is not clear what they could contribute to the aims of automatic speech processing, and secondly that they may fulfill so many different functions that it seems difficult to identify the information relevant to such aims.",
        "In this study, it will firstly be investigated what these discourse particles contribute to natural human-to-human conversation with the aim to determine which of their functions can be useful for automatic speech processing.",
        "In order to make use of the information they provide, however, they need to be disambiguated.",
        "Two different strategies will be employed to disambiguate them automatically: On the one hand their position with respect to the turn and utterance in which they occur will be investigated in order to see how much it contributes to the interpretation of a discourse particle occurrence, on the other their role in the dialogue structure, especially regarding a dialogue model, will be analyzed.",
        "These two types of information, position and dialogue acts, are particularly easy to obtain during automatic speech processing.",
        "The aim of this investigation is thus to determine",
        "• what discourse particles contribute to human-to-human dialogues; • what they may contribute to automatic speech processing; • in how far their surface properties, in particular their position regarding the",
        "turn and the utterance, influence their functions;",
        "• what the dialogue structure may contribute to their automatic disambiguation; • how these aspects interact and how this interaction can be modelled in an actual automatic speech processing system.",
        "It will be shown that the two types of information involved suffice to disambiguate a considerable portion of discourse particle occurrences and that there is consequently no reason to eliminate them from automatic speech processing.",
        "Finally, a model for an implementation in a semantic network for the automatic disambiguation of discourse particles will be proposed."

        "The following examples from a corpus recorded in the appointment scheduling domain (Verbmobil Database, TP13) show several different functions the English discourse particle yeah may fulfill:",
        "(1) 13BAR: what about the 186 of December?",
        "14RIC: <P> yeah, yeah, that work.",
        "(2) lUMI: yeah, we've got to get together and discuss <P> Stufe A fiir die Stu-dienordnung.1 (3) 124ENG: so that won't work either.",
        "125UMI: yeah, that's not good.",
        "(4) 3RIC: I'm Ric M. and I am <P> what do I do?",
        "(whispering) software .",
        "yeah, I'm working for a software account2",
        "The dialogue between native speakers of English was recorded at a German University.",
        "21n these dialogues, recorded for scenario design, speakers are assigned a new identity.",
        "In example (1), yeah is a positive answer to a proposal.",
        "In (2), it functions as a signal by means of which the speaker introduces a new topic, here it opens up the conversation, constituting the first utterance in the dialogue; in example (3), it serves to give feedback to the hearer, indicating perception and understanding and also basic agreement with the partner (Schegloff, 1982).",
        "Finally, in example (4), yeah occurs after a speech management problem, that is, after the speaker does not know how to continue.",
        "Other discourse particles may fulfill similar functions: in example (5), the discourse particle rnrrun functions as a signal of perception and understanding, and so does the first well in example (6) while it furthermore relates the current utterance to the previous.",
        "The second instance of well in this example marks a thematic break, concluding the topic concerning the partner's cold and returning to the previous attempt to find a possible date for a meeting.",
        "This discourse structuring function can also be found for the hesitation marker uh in example (7).",
        "(5) 161IMI: yeah, just one of the students about San Soto anyway.",
        "17ENG: mmm (6) 6UM1: I've got <P>",
        "7ENG: well, you've got a very heavy cold, but well <P> wh,/ wh/ why is this week out of the question?",
        "(7) 114UMI: yeah, this weekend's k k k completely chaotic.",
        "Oz.",
        "let's see.",
        "Thus, the functions discourse particles may fulfill are as follows: they mark thematic breaks, thus making the macro-structural organisation of the dialogue transparent for the hearer; they signal the relatedness of the current utterance to the previous, they indicate whether the information transfer is successful, and whether the channel is still available.",
        "Finally they support the formulation process in case there are speech management problems.",
        "Thus, they may fulfill a large but not an unlimited number of functions.",
        "Furthermore, several of these functions have been found to co-occur in stable feature bundles.",
        "For instance, in example (6), the first instance of well displays perception and understanding of what the partner has said and furthermore indicates that the speaker is going to add something to the same topic.",
        "The same information is conveyed by yeah in example (3).",
        "This implies that there are not only co-occurrence relations between different functional features but also that.",
        "a general inventory of pragmatic interpretation of discourse particles can be proposed, such that the same pragmatic function can be fulfilled by different discourse particles.",
        "The linguistic model presented here consequently assumes that each discourse particle can be assigned a context-specific interpretation (StenstrOm, 1994) which belongs to a limited inventory and which can be seen as a bundle of functional features which may be fulfilled by several different discourse particles.",
        "Additional information is carried by the lexernes themselves (Fischer, 1996), for instance, in the case of yes agreement, and rejection in the case of no.",
        "The descriptive inventory, which was arrived at by means of several hypothesis-test-cycles on the basis of four large corpora (Fischer and Johanntokrax, 1995; Schmitz and Fischer, 1995), consists of the following items:",
        "• take-up: signals perception and understanding regarding the previous utterance and takes up the current topic; • backchannel: gives feedback and supports the other's turn; • frame: marks a break in the thematic structure; • repair marker: signals problems in the formulation process; • answer: signals agreement on, or rejection of, a proposition; • check: signals the hearer that the speaker would like to get positive feedback; • modal: refers to the common ground or the information 'on hand;' establishes a relation of coherence between the utterance and a pragmatic pretext.",
        "In how far can these functions now be used for automatic speech processing?",
        "On the one hand, the most trivial point is the ambiguity of certain discourse particles concerning propositional and other information, for example German ja, nein, dock or nicht, or English yes or no.",
        "Information on this ambiguity is essential for automatic speech processing systems since if it is not resolved, Contradictory or just wrong information will be inferred.",
        "Consider the following proposal for an appointment in example (8).",
        "(8) geht es nicht um 13 Uhr?",
        "(isn't it possible at 1 p.m.?)",
        "In this example the discourse particle nicht does not contribute to the propositional information; however, it does so in the following example: (9) es geht nicht urn 13 Uhr.",
        "(it isn't possible at 1 p.m..) The examples demonstrate the need for the disambiguation of discourse particle occurrences since the recognition of keywords such as nicht would lead to wrong conclusions regarding the first example; however, disregarding it would obscure the proposition in the second example.",
        "On the other hand, if the different functions of discourse particles can he automatically determined, they can also support further semantic and pragmatic analyses concerning the information structure and the macro-structural organisation of a dialogue, segmentation, and the recognition of repair sequences in the same way as they are taken as signals by human speech processors.",
        "Automatic disambiguation of discourse particles is therefore essential to their further employment in automatic speech processing systems."

        "For instance, in the informal task-oriented human-to-human dialogues, 40.43% (standard deviation 7.9) of the discourse functions of ja could be assigned correctly by the artificial neural network classificator only on the basis of the information which the preceding and which the following dialogue act was, although in this corpus the number of dialogue acts assigned is quite high, and the relationship between them is highly variable.",
