        "These are continuers, agreements, yes-answers, and incipient-speakership.",
        "What makes these four types so difficult to distinguish is that they all can be realized by common words like uh-huh, yeah, right, yes, okay.",
        "But while some tokens (like yeah) are highly ambiguous, others, (like uh-huh or okay) are somewhat less ambiguous, occurring with different likelihoods in different DAs.",
        "This suggests a generalization of the 'cue word' hypothesis: while some utterances may be ambiguous, in general the lexical form of a DA places strong constraints on which DA the utterance can realize.",
        "Indeed, we and our colleagues as well as many other researchers working on automatic DA recognition, have found that the words and phrases in a DA were the strongest cue to its identity.",

        "In fact uh-huh is twice as likely as yeah to be used as a continuer, while yeah is three times as likely as uh-huh to be used to take the floor.",
        "Our results differ somewhat from earlier statistical investigation of incipient speakership.",
        "In their analysis of 750 acknowledge tokens from telephone conversations, Drummond and Hopper (1993a) found that yeah was used to initiate a turn about half the time, while uh huh and rnm-hm were only used to take the floor 4% – 5% of the time.",
        "Note that in Table 6, uh-huh is used to take the floor 1402 times.",

        "This difference could be caused by differences between SWBD and their corpora, and bears further investigation.",
        "Drummond and Hopper (1993b) were not able to separately code yes-answers and agreements, which suggests that their study might be extended in this way.",
        "Since we did code these separately, we also checked to see what percentage of just the backchannel uses of yeah marked incipient speakership.",
        "We found that 41% of the backchannel uses of yeah were used to take the floor (4773/(4773+6961)) similar to their finding of 46%.",

        "The word no, while not unique (it also marks incipient speakership), is a generally good discriminative cue for agreement (it is very commonly used to agree with negative statements).",
        "We are currently investigating speaker-dependencies in the realization of these four DAs.",

        "For this set of 44 conversations, 114 of the 5757 originally labeled Dialog Acts (2%) were changed, The fact that 98% of the DAs were unchanged suggests that DA labeling from text transcriptions was probably a good idea for our purposes overall.",

        "Second, continuer -* agreement changes often played a causal role in the other changes: a continuer which changed to an agreement often caused a preceding statement to be relabeled as an opinion.",
        "There are a number of potential causes for the high rate of continuer agreement changes.",
        "First, because continuers were more frequent and less marked than agreements, labelers were originally instructed to code ambiguous cases as contin",

        "Second, the two codes often shared identical lexical form: as was mentioned above, while some speakers used lexical form to distinguish agreements from continuers, many others used prosody.",

        "In general, continuers are shorter in duration, less intonationally marked (lower FO.",

        "if it ends in a continuation rise.",
        "This has the effect of inviting the other speaker to continue, resembling question intonation for English.",
        "A high fall, on the other hand, sounds more like an agreement than a continuer.",

        "One mark of a dispreferred response is a significant pause before speaking.",
        "Thus when listening, a DA which was marked as an agreement in the text could be easily heard as a continuer if it began with a particularly long pause.",
