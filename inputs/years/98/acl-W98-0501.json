        "In fact, our understanding of the potential benefits of the linguistic means can increase only if our practical solutions stand on an adequate descriptive basis.",
        "Traditionally, grammatical models have been constructed by linguists without any consideration for computational application, and later, by computationally oriented scientists who have first taken a parsable mathematical model and then forced the linguistic description into the model which has usually been too weak to describe what a linguist would desire.",
        "Our approach is somewhere between these two extremes.",
        "While we define the grammar strictly in linguistic terms, we simultaneously test it in the parsing framework.",
        "What is exceptional here is that the parsing framework is not restricted by an arbitrary mathematical model such as a context-free phrase structure grammar.",
        "This leads us to a situation where the parsing problem is extremely hard in the general, theoretical case, but fortunately parsable in practise.",
        "Our result shows that, while in general we have an NP-hard parsing problem, there is a specific solution for the given grammar that can be run quickly.",
        "Currently, the speed of the parsing system' is several hundred words per second.",
        "In short, the grammar should be empirically motivated.",
        "We have all the reason to believe that if a linguistic analysis rests on a solid descriptive basis, analysis tools based on the theory would be more useful for practical purposes.",
        "We are studying the possibilities of using computational implementation as a developing and testing environment for a grammatical formalism.",

        "Those who began",
        "to use dependency models in the 1960's largely ignored descriptive adequacy in order to develop models which were mathematically simple and, as a consequence, for which effective parsing algorithms could be presented.",

        "Coordination should not be seen as a directed functional relation, but instead as a special connexion between two functionally equal elements.",
        "The coordination connexions are called junctions in Tesniere (1959, Chs.",
        "134-150).",
        "Tesniere considered junctions primarily as a mechanism to pack multiple sentences economically into one.",
        "Unfortunately, his solution, which represents all coordinative connexions in stemmas, is not adequate, because due to cyclic arcs the result is no longer a tree.",
        "Our solution is to pay due respect to the formal properties of the dependency model, which requires that each element should have one and only one head.15 This means that coordinated elements are chained (Figure 4) using a specific arc for coordination (labeled as cc).",
        "The coordinators are mostly redundant markers (Tesniere, 1959, Ch.",
        "39:5)16, especially, they do not have \"Listed in Voutilainen (1994).",
        "\"The treatment of coordination and gapping in Ka-hane (1997) resembles ours in simple cases.",
        "However, this model maintains projectivity, and consequently, both multiple heads and extended nuclei, which are essentially phrase-level units, are used in complex cases, making the model broadly similar to Hudson (1991).",
        "\"The redundancy is shown in the existence of asyn-detic coordination.",
        "As syntactic markers, coordinators are not completely void of semantic content, which is",
        "any (governing) role in the syntactic structure as they do in many word-based forms of dependency theory (e.g. Kunze (1975) and Mel'Euk (1987)).",
        "Unlike the other arcs in the tree, the arc marking coordination does not imply a dependency relation but rather a functional equivalence.",
        "If we assume that the coordinated elements have exactly the same syntactic functions, the information available is similar to that provided in Tesniere's representation.",

        "In gapping, only the coordinator is present while the verb is missing.",
        "One can think that as the coordinator represents all missing elements in the clause, it inherits all properties of the missing (verbal) elements (Figure 6).",

        "Due to 'flatness' of dependency model, there is no problem to describe gapping where a subject rather than complements are involved, as the Figure 5 shows.",
