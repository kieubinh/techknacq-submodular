        "1.1 As has been argued in detail in Sgall et al.",
        "(1986), there are good reasons (concerning the semantic relevance as well as syntactic constraints of the topic-focus articulation, see below) to distinguish three layers of the order of the occurrences of lexical (autosemantic) items in the sentence: (i) the surface word order, which can be understood as the order of items on the level of morphemics; on that level the sentence representation has the shape of a string of word-forms (rather than that of a tree); (ii) the communicative dynamism (underlying word order), i.e. the order of nodes in an underlying (tectogrammatical) representation (TR), which has the shape of a dependency tree; the topic of the sentence is characterized as consisting of items which are less dynamic than those belonging to its focus; thus, if A belongs to the topic in all TRs of a given sentence S and B belongs to the focus in some of the Ms of S, then A is less dynamic than B; (iii) the systemic ordering of valency slots (kinds of dependency relation), which is specified in the valency frames (included in the lexical entries), see Sgall et al.",
        "(1986), Sgall (in press).",
        "Let us illustrate the mentioned three layers by the following example (with the capitals denoting the intonation center of the sentence): The work on this paper was supported by the grant of the Czech Grant Agency CACI?",
        "405/96/K214.",
        "(1) My sister was visited by a painter in PARIS last week.",
        "A difference between (i) and (ii) - the surface word order and the communicative dynamism - concerns here the fact that the most dynamic item (the bearer of the intonation center) does not occupy its prototypical position at the end of the sentence.",
        "Since the temporal adverbial at the end follows the intonation center, it can only be understood as belonging to the topic of the sentence, i.e. as less dynamic than the focus.",
        "Let us assume that the preferred reading of (1) - see Fig.1 - can be paraphrased as \"As for the last week in my sister's life, (she) was (then) visited by a painter in Paris\"; the order of the valency slots (the communicative dynamism) of the (tectogranunatical) syntactic tree representing this reading is, in ascending order, Patient (Objective) - Temporal-when - Actor - Locative (with the Patient being the least dynamic item, i.e. the topic proper, and the verb being less dynamic than the Actor and more dynamic than the temporal adverbial).",
        "As a matter of fact, another surface order corresponding to this underlying tree may be that of (2):",
        "(2) Last week, my sister was visited by a painter in PARIS.",
        "The relationship between (ii) and (iii) is reflected in (1) by the fact that the above mentioned ascending order of valency slots is in accordance with the systemic ordering within the focus (Actor preceding Locative), while this is not the case with the position of Actor with regard to the two valency slots in the topic: Actor follows both Temporal and Objective, although the systemic ordering of these three valemcy slots is Temporal - Actor - Objective (see Hajilova and Sgall 1987; Hajitovi 1991).",
        "This difference is determined by the fact that the parts of the topic are less dynamic than those of the focus, even if the degrees of dynamism are then not in accordance with systemic ordering.",
        "The restriction that the communicative dynamism within the focus part of the sentence is in accordance with systemic ordering, is crucial for the specification of syntactic representations, as will be seen in paragraph (ii)(b) in Sect.",
        "5.3.",
        "1.2 The differences in communicative dynamism are relevant not only for the appropriateness of the use of the given sentence in this or that context, but also semantically, even in the narrow sense of differences in truth conditions.",
        "This clearly concerns sentences with certain kinds of complex quantification, such as (3), but also sentences without such (overt) quantifiers, such as (4) - (7) (I mostly use examples taken from earlier linguistic discussions):",
        "(3) (a) Two languages are known by everybody in this ROOM.",
        "(b) Everybody in this room knows two LANGUAGES.",
        "(4) (a) He wrote his dissertation on SUNDAYS.",
        "(b) On Sundays he wrote his DISSERTATION.",

        "(c) An explosion was seen by JOHN AND MARY.",
        "(d) An EXPLOSION was seen by John and Mary.",
        "With (6c) John and Mary could have seen different explosions, which is not the case with (7c), at least on the preferred reading.",
        "It is worth noting that the mere change of the position of the intonation center in (7d) gives a reading different",
        "from (7c), namely the same reading as that of (6c).",

        "This is much easier with dependency syntax than with the constituency based descriptions where order is handled as closely connected with the determination of syntactic relations.",
        "However, it is impossible to straightforwardly copy in these representations the surface order, due to the differences between these two layers, as illustrated in 1.1 above, in the discussion of example (1).",
        "These differences may be described by means of movement rules, or perhaps e.g. of numerical indices for underlying positions and of specific topic and focus slots, as Starosta (1993; in press) proposes.",
        "It would deserve a systematic investigation to find whether such an approach allows to account in a natural way not only for the subtle relationships between surface word order, communicative dynamism and the systemic ordering, but also for those concerning the different positions of quantifiers or of 'focalizers', cf. Hajieova et al.",
        "(in press).",
        "Of course, an important methodological requirement is to minimize the number of movement rules, and of all distinctions between morphemic strings and syntactic representations, be they treated as constituting two layers of description or as corresponding to different subsets of symbols within complex node values.",
        "In any case, at least the following issues have to be accounted for, and we indicate below how this can be done by means of movement rules (cf. Sect.",
        "5.4): (a) Sentences with a secondary (other than rightmost) placement of the intonation center, which marks the position of focus, cf. (1) and its TR in Fig. 1 above; see also (7d); for Czech, the rule may transfer the riglunost item of the TR to the leftmost position, marking the moved item as the bearer of the intonation center of the sentence (which then, in phonemics, gets a falling stress).",
        "(b) Grammatically determined positions of verbs, adjectives, clitics, and so on, in different languages; the adjective primarily is more dynamic than its head noun, but it is placed to its left in English surface word order; in Czech clitics usually are placed in the \"second\" (Wackemagel's) position, even if they depend on an infinitive standing after the main verb: (9) Martin mi ji to chtel UKAZAT.",

        "Wackemagel's position, into which the moved items usually are placed, is the position just after the leftmost node of the uppermost part of the tree (and, if the leftmost node differs from the verb, also after all nodes subordinated to the leftmost one).",
        "(c) Positions of function words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions, auxiliaries), which need not have any nodes as their underlying counterparts (just indices within node labels, see Section 4 below): in the morphemic string (i.e. in the surface word order) they are usually placed at the beginning of their word groups; the rules describing these movements are to be combined with changing the indices in the complex node labels into symbols of articles, prepositions, etc.",
        "(11) Jim visited me, since he wanted to ask me for ADVICE.",
        "(d) Also other cases of apparent non-projectivity (i.e. peripheral, strongly limited cases) can be described by movement rules concerning morphemics: (12) I met a man yesterday, who asked me for your ADDRESS.",

        "(13) a larger town than Boston:",
        "The order in the TR: larger - than Boston - town.",
        "The use of movement rules, rather than of numerical indices for underlying positions enables us to work with perspicuous syntactic representations reflecting all the differences illustrated in the above quoted examples, including an economical handling of systemic ordering and dynamism.",
        "Even when attempting at a monostratal description, it is always necessary to distinguish between morphemics and syntax, e.g. by using abstract symbols in the complex labels of nodes; thus, also with such an approach the problem stressed by Starosta (1993) is still present, namely the danger that abstract symbols might get too far from the empirical properties of language.",

        "Using movement rules to describe relationships between syntax and morphemics makes it possible to treat these two levels apart, with simple strings of (complex) symbols as morphemic representations, and trees (or more complex networks) as syntactic ones.",
        "It is necessary to distinguish these two levels at least for two reasons: (i) the relation between a function word and its autosemantic 'partner' differs essentially from the dependency relation: a preposition or article cannot occupy any other position than that of accompanying a noun; an auxiliary or (typically) a conjunction always accompanies a verb; in this point they are similar to endings, rather than to adjuncts; it is essentially more economical to have just",

        "Such cases can be found in many languages, cf. e.g. in Czech the conjunction ii 'if (occurring only after a verb form and attached to it by a hyphen, so that the intermediate position between a function word and a suffix of the verb is clearly manifested), or the clitic s (auxiliary of the 2nd Person Sing.",

        "From surface (morphemics) to (underlying) syntax",
        "In the primary unmarked situation, morphemes (endings, prepositions, other function words) express dependency relations and values of morphological categories (number, definitness, tense, aspect, modalities, degrees of comparison), whereas surface (morphemic) word order expresses the basic scale of the topic-focus articulation, i.e. that of communicative dynamism.",
        "Prototypically these two orders are identical, the differences - described by movement rules - are relatively rare and can be described by a limited number of rules.",
        "The core of the transition from morphemic strings to syntactic representations (preliminary formulations of implemented procedures for which can be found with Kirschner 1987; Hajitovi et al.",
        "1994) then is to describe the transition from endings and function words to their functions.",
        "Thus, a Genitive typically depends on the adjacent noun, a prepositional group usually expresses an adverbial (dependent on the verb), prepositions have either their primary 'meanings', as e.g. E. with: Accompaniment or Means, from: Directional.1, through: Directional.3, or they have their syntactic functions (they express certain kinds of dependency relation; perhaps it would be more exact to see dependency as a family of relations) - to: Addressee, by: Actor with Passive.",
        "Another part of the task is to proceed from surface word order and certain properties of sentence prosody (positions of the intonation center or the main stress of the sentence, and of phrasal stress) to the scale of dynamism.",
        "In non-prototypical (not just marginal) cases the word order expresses syntactic (dependency) relations.",
        "Among such cases there is the English 'configurationality' with the order Actor, verb and Objective; however, even in English, as soon as other kinds of the dependency relations are encountered, it is necessary to take morphemes into account (in English - prepositions, see above; in most Continental languages - case endings; in the agglutinating languages of Asia and other regions - suffixes; verb categories are practically always expressed by morphemes, etc.).",
        "Furthermore, it is necessary to restore the deleted items; this task has often been discussed with different frameworks, but an adequate solution still seems to be connected with many open questions.",
        "One of them is that it is not easy to draw the boundary line between those cases in which the deleted lexical unit is to be inserted as such, and cases in which just an anaphoric or indexical item is appropriate.",
        "The former case clearly concerns at least the basic kinds of coordination deletion (e.g. with blue and yellow flag it is appropriate to restore blue flag in the TR).",

        "Another kind of rules concerns the changes of tectogranunatical values such as Plural, Preterite, Feminine, Comparative into morphemic items (endings, alternations, affixes, function words) and the placement of these morphemic items.",
