        "The interpretation of norninalized expressions in English poses several problems.",

        "Second, different forms of norninalizations differ in their semantic behaviour.",
        "Finally, aspectual restrictions which exist for ingoi-nominals must be explained.",
        "The solution to be proposed is based on the assumption that non-stative verbs denote changes.",
        "Changes can be conceived of in two different ways, either as objects which bring about a particular result or as relations between states.",
        "A dynamic structure of events, intervals and states is defined in which both perspectives can be expressed by means of sorting the universe D. The basic idea is to augment a transition system for Dynamic Logic (DL) by a further domain of events such that programs from DL can be described either as objects or relations between states.",
        "The interpretation of verbs is based on the second perspective: they denote (generalized) relations between states.",
        "The interpretation of nominalized expressions uses the first perspective: they denote changes as objects.",
        "Different forms of nominalizations denote different sorts of objects which are systematically related to the denotation of the underlying verb."

        "In English (at least) three forms of nominalizations exist.",
        "(1) a. the performance of the song (by the soprano) b. the performing of the song (by the soprano) c. the soprano's performing the song",
        "The NP in (la) is usually called a derived nominal, the NP in (lb) an ingof nominal and the NP in (lc) a gerundive nominal.",
        "It is commonly assumed that these forms are morphologically and semantically derived from the underlying verb, i.e. peiform in (1).",
        "Evidence for this assumption comes from the following data.",
        "First, sentence (2a) is true just in case its corresponding 'statement of occurrence' (Zucchi (1993)) (2b) is true.",
        "(2) a.",
        "The soprano performed the song at 9:00. b.",
        "A performance/performing of the song by the soprano occurred at 9:00.",
        "For gerundive nominals a similar equivalence exists.",

        "The soprano's singing the song surprised us.",
        "b.",
        "That the soprano performed the song surprised us.",
        "From this equivalence it cannot be inferred that a gerundive nominal and a that-clause have the same denotation.",
        "Only the latter can be arguments of verbs like believe and know or of predicates like is true or is false.",
        "This is the so-called distribution-problem.",
        "This first set of data gives rise to the following constraint which a semantic analysis of nominalizations must satisfy (Zucchi (1993)): The semantic properties of ingor, derived and gerundive nominals should be accounted for without assuming that they are listed in the lexicon, but rather by assuming that they are generated by a rule from the meanings of the corresponding verbs.",
        "Second, similar to 'ordinary' nouns like 'man' derived/ingornominals (but not gerundive",
        "norninals) allow determiners (4a), yet all forms of no was slow/sudden/took a long time.",

        "These data show that nominalized NPs should get an interpretation which m4kes their type compatible with that assigned to 'ordinary' NPs like 'a man' or 'John'.",
        "Otherwise, predicates like 'is strange' will be type ambiguous, making it necessary to explain in a systematic way the (semantic) relationship that exists between different occurrences of a predicate.",
        "This yields a second constraint: Derived and ing‘nominals must be assigned meanings in such a way that it is possible to give a uniform interpretation of determiners like some or the.",
        "A third set of data concerns semantic differences between derived and ingor nominals (which behave semantically (almost) alike) on the one hand and gerundive nominals on the other.",
        "First, whereas a sentence containing a derived/ingenominal has two readings, the corresponding sentence with a gerundive nominal admits of only one reading.",

        "b.",
        "The soprano's performing the song surprised us.",
        "(5a) has two readings.",
        "According to the first, the existential-reading, it is the mere performance which surprised us and not some specific quality the performance had.",
        "On the second reading, the property-reading, it is some property the performance had which was surprising and not the fact that it occurred at all.",
        "By contrast, sentence (5b) with a gerundive nominal has only the existential-reading according to which the soprano was not expected to perform the song.",
        "The property-reading is excluded.",
        "A second difference concerns selectional distinctions: gerundive and ingoi-nominals do not occur with the same range of predicates.",
        "(6) a.",

        "Whereas gerundive nominals are not possible with predicates like is slow or take a long time, they are acceptable with surprise.",
        "For ingo-nominals there are no such restrictions.",
        "A final difference has to do with restrictions on which predicates do at all admit a particular type of nominalization.",

        "In Naumann (1996,1997a,b) a theory of aspectual phenomena has been developed which is based on the intuition that non-stative verbs like eat or run express changes.",
        "The intuitive notion of a change comprises at least the following two aspects which are complementary to each other.",
        "(i) something (an object) which brings about the change (ii) something (a result) which is brought about by the change which did not hold before the change occurred",
        "The notion of a change that is used in (i) and (ii), respectively, refers in each case to the other aspect.",
        "In (i) 'change' is understood as the result that is brought about, i.e., in the sense that is captured by (ii), whereas in (ii) 'change' is meant as the object that brings about the result.",
        "The second aspect can be described as a transformation of state.",
        "Before the change occurred, the world was in a particular state, say s, in which some condition (property) 4) did not hold,",
        "whereas after the change has occurred, the world is in a state s' in which 4) does hold.",
        "This perspective is captured in Dynamic Logic (DL).",
        "Some input-state s in which -.4) holds is transformed into an output-state s' in which 4) holds.",
        "Program-letters it are interpreted as binary relations on the domain S of states: [it] c S x S. The elements of [it] (pairs of states) can be interpreted as particular executions of the program.",
        "Each program letter defines an accessibility relation such that DL is a polymodal logic.",
        "The fact that (s,s') E [it] means that state s' can be reached (or is accessible) from state s by executing the program it in s. It is therefore possible to view the program letter it as a label by which transitions between states can be decorated: s – Kit) s' holds just in case (s,s') E [it] and is to be read as 'by executing It in state s state s' is reached'.",
        "The disadvantage of the perspective which underlies DL is that changes are only derived objects, i.e. pairs of states or relations between states, that are defined in terms of the domain S of states.",
        "There is no separate domain E the elements of which are interpreted as bringing about the transformations of a state s to a state s' denoted by rt.",
        "It is therefore not possible to interpret IL, when it is used to label a transition, as the object that brings about this transition because it is not interpreted as an independent object.",
        "What is not captured in DL, therefore, is the first perspective mentioned above in (i) according to which a change can be understood as an object which brings about a particular result.",
        "This perspective is captured, among others, in event-semantics (ES), Krifica (1992), where events are interpreted as elements of a separate domain E. What is missing in ES is the second perspective of a change as a state-transformer according to which events effect changes by bringing about some result 4).",
        "The two perspectives can be combined in the following way.",
        "Each event e is of a particular type P, where the index v corresponds to some (non-stative) verb from English, say eat or run.",
        "The elements of the event-type P„ are characterized by bringing about (or effecting) a change with respect to some property.",
        "For instance, events of type eat bring about changes with respect to the mass of an object.",
        "This object is denoted by the internal argument of eat, say an apple in eat an apple.",
        "The result 4) that holds with respect to this property upon termination of the event is that the mass is zero, i.e., the object has vanished.",
        "Events of type run, on the other hand, bring about a change with respect to the location of the object that is denoted by the external argument, e.g. John in John ran.",
        "The location of the object at the end of the event is different from its location at the beginning of the event (to be precise, the change need not always consist in a change of location.",
        "Events of type run around the park are possible counterexamples.",
        "Rather, the object traverses a non-empty path.",
        "Whereas the path is empty when the event is started, it is non-empty at its end).",
        "Events of type eat differ from those of type run in the way the result 4) is brought about.",
        "This can be illustrated by means of the notion of a nucleus-structure (Moens/Steedman (1988)).",
        "A nucleus-structure consists of three parts: the inception-point (IP), the development-portion (DP) and the culmination-point (CP).",
        "The result 4) is evaluated at each part of the nucleus-structure.",
        "(Sequential) events of type eat and run agree on how 4) is evaluated at the IP and at the CP: it is false at the IP and true at the CP.",
        "They differ with respect to the DP.",
        "Whereas 4) is constantly false on the DP for events of type eat, it continuously holds for events of type run.",
        "From this it follows that for events of type eating 4) only holds at the CP and is therefore true at exactly one point of the nucleus-structure, whereas for events of type running 4) is false at only one point of the nucleus-structure, namely at the IP.",
        "The distinction between events of type eat and those of type run is therefore made in terms of how the result 4) is evaluated at intermediate states of an occurrence.",
        "Aspectually it is therefore not the mere input-output behaviour that is important but also what happens in between the beginning and the end of an occurrence.",
        "From a procedural perspective the nucleus-structure can be interpreted as the execution-sequence a of some program rt.",
        "The IP corresponds",
        "to the input-state s, the CP to the output-state s' and the DP to the set of intermediate states s\" in between s and s': s < s\" < s' (where < is the ordering on a or some global ordering induced on the domain S).",
        "Thus, to each event e corresponds its execution-sequence a (= (s,s')) such that each event-type P,, induces a binary relation IC on S such that each element of IC is the execution sequence of a (completed) event e E P„.",
        "The binary relation R,, is the result of applying a so-called dynamic mode to a property of states Q.",
        "The dynamic modes corresponding to an accomplishment-verb like eat and an activity-verb like run are given in (8a) and (8b), respectively.",
        "In (8) Q is a property of states corresponding to the result that an event of type 13,, is supposed to bring about.",
        "Not all events of type P„ will satisfy OPv(Q) (for OP,, the dynamic mode assigned to P,,) on their execution-sequence but only a certain subset, namely the completed sequential ones (for details see Naumann (1998) and section (2.1) below).",
        "The MIN-BEC-mode (partly) characterizes the class of accomplishments.",
        "This means that a verb-type v which belongs to this class is assigned this mode.",
        "Activity-verbs like push are assigned Con-BEC, the mode characterizing the class of activities.",
        "Other aspectual classes are characterized by different modes, Naumann (1997a,b), Naumann/Mori (1998).",
        "The dynamic mode assigned to an event-type 13,, determines therefore the way in which a change effected by an event of this type is basically brought about.",
        "On this view events are a sort of 'reification' of particular executions of the program it.",
        "In terms of it as a label of transitions this means that instead of s – *(n) s' one now has s – >(e) s' such that e E 13,, and (s,s') E R [ic]) where IC is the binary relation induced by 13,,.",
        "In contrast to the DL-perspective the label e can be interpreted as the object that brings about the transition from s to s'.",
        "The above considerations are made precise in the following definition.",
        "Definition: a dynamic-temporal structure of events, intervals and states of signature <VERB., VERB„ VAR, TR, DM> is a tuple <D, E, S, 0, T, I, a, B, ji, y, 8, x, x*, V'E VERB„ {E} ie TR, (ono°, cogn> such that",

        "In the previous section it was shown that the intuitive notion of a change covers two different, yet complementary perspectives.",
        "A change can be viewed either as an object or as a transformation of state.",
        "The first perspective is related to the eventuality structure E whereas the second perspective is linked to the dynamic transition structure S. These two complementary perspectives will be used for the interpretation of verbs and derived/ingoi-nominals.",
        "In principle, each of the two perspectives can be used for the interpretation of both verbs and derived/ingornominals.",
        "In ES the first perspective is chosen for the interpretation of verbs.",

        "In contrast to ES, the translation of verbs in the present approach will be based on the second perspective of a change.",
        "This decision is based on two reasons.",
        "First, 'ordinary', i.e. non-derived nouns, like man for instance, are usually analyzed as denoting sets of objects of the basic domain D. Using type-theory, this means that they are translated as expressions of type <e,t> (where De = D).",
        "From this it follows that derived and ingornominals should be interpreted as denoting sets of basic entities too.",
        "In the present framework there are five basic domains: 0,E,I,T and S. It is therefore possible to distinguish between five different (non-logical) sorts of basic expressions because each domain can be taken to be the domain for expressions of a corresponding sort B where B is either o, E, i, tp or s, i.e. the sort of objects, events, intervals, time-points or states.",
        "Above D was defined as the union of the basic domains.",
        "The sorting of the universe D can be used at the level of types of expressions by letting each expression of type <BA> for B E (o,e,i,s,tp) be also of type <e,t>.",
        "It is then possible to translate nouns uniformly as expressions of type <e,t>, i.e. as denoting sets of elements from D, which can be further subclassi-fied according to the sorts o, e, i, tp and s. For instance, the translation of man will be an expression of type <o,t>, denoting sets of 'ordinary' objects (that is, elements from 0).",
        "Derived nouns like performance of the song by the soprano and ingot-nominals like performing of the song by the soprano are translated as expressions of type <E,t> which denote sets of events.",
        "The second reason has to do with the distinction between the translations of verbal and nominal expressions.",
        "On the present account, an n-place verb will be translated as an expression of type <al..., <a„,<s,<s,t>»...>, where the a„ 15i5n, are the types of the (translations of the) subcategorized ('ordinary') arguments.",
        "From this it follows that the translations of sentence radicals like John run or Mary eat an apple are of type <s,<s,t>>.",
        "They denote binary relations on S and, consequently, no sets of basic objects.",
        "This is in contrast to nominal expressions the translations of which are of type <a\",<B,t» for an a (possibly empty) sequence of types and B a basic type.",
        "After the first n arguments have been discharged, nominal expression like man or peifornzing of the song by the soprano therefore denote sets of elements of some basic domain DB.",
        "Thus, verbal expressions are semantically distinguished from nominal ones.",
        "Whereas (the dynamic components of) the latter denote sets of entities, the (dynamic components of) former denote binary relations on S. The main task consists in showing how the non-relational perspective can be derived from the relational perspective that is used for the interpretation of verbs in the lexicon.",
        "Each event e of type Pv for some v is related to an n+2 tuple <x1,..., x„,s,s'> of objects (individuals): Ve e 1° „ – x,...xn3ss'[(e,x1) E 01 A ... (e,x„) E en A ¶*(e) = (s,s')] by means of the functions a*, B*, lc and K*.",
        "The pair (s,s') is the execution-sequence of e. The x, are the values for e of the thematic relations for which the event-type P, is defined according to K. From this it follows that each Pv induces an n+2-ary relation 12, defined in (10).",
        "The condition (i) requires that the value for e of each 0-role for which P„ is defined is an argument of the relation and that the i-th argument of R is the value of e for the i-th 0-role assigned to P‘,.",

        "In (10b) and the definitions that follow condition (i) will therefore be reduced to (e,x,) E Let {R,,} v E 'VERB1 be the set of (induced) binary relations corresponding to (10).",
        "R„ will be used in the interpretation of the verb v in the lexicon although this relation itself cannot be taken as the denotation of the verb.",
        "Rather, v denotes a subset of Rv, namely that subset such that (s,s') e OP(Q) with OP = y(Pv) and Q = 8(P„).",

        "For a particular v, the change is brought about in some specific way determined by the dynamic mode y(P,,) with respect to the property Q (= 8(Pv)).",
        "For instance, events of type eating bring about a change with respect to the mass of an object that is denoted by the internal argument and the property Q is that the mass be zero.",
        "An attempt to bring about Q by eating can fail.",
        "For instance, if only half of the object is eaten, Q does not hold in the final state of the execution.",

        "In section (2.1) the derivation of ingenominals from verbs was semantically analyzed as a mapping that makes use of the double perspective in which a change can be described in the dynamic event-structure defined above.",
        "The analysis of gerundive nominals is based on a third perspective.",
        "Whenever an event e of some type P occurs, a corresponding sequence a is (partially) realized on the runtime t(e) of e, namely that sequence a such that t(e) = i and 11*(0 = (s,s') (i.e. T*(e) = (s,s')).",
        "The occurrence of e therefore partly determines the world when it occurs by bringing about 8(P) in the way corresponding to y(P).",
        "Thus, each event e can be said to leave some trace behind.",
        "This trace concerns the property that is changed by the event, e.g. the location of some object.",
        "The trace of an event can be defined as a pair <i, OP(Q)> and thus as a property of intervals.",
        "Properties of intervals can be taken to be states of affairs (SOAs), i.e., partial constellations the world is in during some period.",
        "SOAs as properties of intervals are a third perspective in which a change can be described.",
        "It will be argued that gerundive nominals denote SOAs.",
        "First, intervals are objects which are neither slow or sudden nor can they be said to take a long time.",
        "Second, on the existential reading it is the occurrence of an event which is surprising.",
        "But whenever an event has occurred, a corresponding SOA has been realized.",
        "This explains the equivalence between The singing of the song by the soprano surprised us and The soprano's singing the song surprised us on the existential reading.",
        "What is surprising about e's runtime interval is the fact that OP(Q) is realized on it.",
        "Third, for an event e there is the further possibility that some other property of it is surprising besides its property of having occurred at all.",
        "Fourth, as the domain D is structured such that E,I, and 0 are subsets of D and gerundive nominals are of sort <i,t>, each expression of this sort is also of sort <e,t>.",
        "One can therefore explain why NPs with gerundive norninals (and ingni-norninals) can occur in subject-position of verbs like is strange without having to assume that the latter is ambiguous.",
        "Fifth, not only traces of events are states of affairs but any property of intervals for some OP, including HOLD, such that there are no aspectual restrictions on gerundive nominals.",
        "Therefore, the notion of a SOA not only comprises changes as intervals on which a change of some property Q occurred but also intervals on which Q continuously holds (as a result of some change brought about by an event e).",

        "There are different methods of how this difference can be handled (Zucchi (1993)).",
