        "In Mikrokosmos, the lexical information is distributed among various levels, relevant to phonology, orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, syntax-semantic linking, stylistics, paradigmatic and syntagmatic information, and also database type management information.3 Each entry consists of a list of words, stored in the lexicon independently of their POS (the verb and noun form of walk are under the same superentry).",
        "Each word meaning is identified by a unique iden-tificator, or lexeme (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994).",
        "Homonyms and all meaning shifts of polyse-mous words are listed under one single superentry.4 We illustrate in Figure 1 relevant aspects, for this paper, of a lexicon entry via the description of two senses of the Chinese word agb (activity): WorkAc-tivity and Exercise, which are well defined symbols or concepts in the Mikrokosmos ontology as described in (Mahesh, 1996).",
        "Word meanings in Mikrokosmos are represented partly in the lexicon and partly in the ontology.",
        "We have strived to achieve an intermediate grain size of meaning representation in both the lexicon and the ontology: many word senses have direct mappings to concepts in the ontology; many others must be decomposed and mapped indirectly through composition and modification of ontological concepts.",
        "We have developed a set of guidelines and a training methodology that results in acceptable quality and uniformity in lexical and ontological representations (Mahesh, 1996; Viegas and Raskin, 1998).",
        "In principle, the separation between ontology and lexicon is as follows: language-neutral meanings are stored in the former; language-specific information in the latter.",
        "We keep the number of concepts well below the number of lexical items for a given language, such",
        "that, for instance, the concept Ingest can be lex-icalised as rit (eat) or rig (drink) according to the constraints put in the lexicon on the theme: Food for eat and Liquid for drink respectively."

        "The advantage of IvISLRs is twofold: first, they can be considered as a means to reduce the number of lexicon entry types, and generally to make the acquisition process faster and cheaper; second, they can enhance the results of analysis processing by creating new entries for unknown words from the lexicon, found in corpora.",

        "This includes creating new syntax, semantics and syntax-semantic mappings with correct subcategorisations and also the right semantics; for instance, the lexical entry for comprable will have the subcategorisation for predicative and attributive adjectives and the semantics adds the attribute \"FeasibilityAttribute\" to the basic meaning \"Buy\" of comprar.",

        "The rules are language independent, what is language dependent is the morphemes to which they can apply.",
