        "In this paper., we are going to describe the natural language understanding component of the TAMIC-P1 system for German, which interprets natural language queries addressing the databases of the Austrian social insurance institution for farmers (Sozialversicherungsanstalt der Bauern, SVB).",
        "The input queries are parsed and mapped onto a representation in quasi-logical form which serves as basis for the required database access.",

        "Additionally, many legal terms which occur in the queries may be linked to the underlying legal regulations.",
        "These regulations are available in hypertext format and allow for browsing via the user interface.",
        "Domain-specific help files will eventually also be integrated in the data to be accessed via the user interface.",
        "An evaluation of the user requirements in this specific natural language task yielded the result that the prospective users of the system, social insurance clerks at local information days, feel most comfortable if they have the possibility to input their queries as noun phrases.",
        "For the natural language query interpretation task, this implies that complex and heterogeneous noun phrases have to be interpreted adequately.",
        "In the following sections, we are going to describe the general aim of the TAMIC-P system, the system scenario, the kind of input the system has to be able to deal with and the parsing process.",
        "We will then give an outline of how some complex queries are treated in parsing, and finally, we are going to conclude with observations (including their implications for further work) derived from the current system setting and its application in the process of parsing NP queries in the TAMIC-P domain."

        "Furthermore, there are several different types of specific 'exemption times because of child raising' (e.g. raising adopted children, grandchildren etc.)",
        "which have to be considered in an evaluation of the insurance records, particularly if a citizen applies for retirement pension.",
        "An evaluation of user queries has shown that the SVB clerks were reluctant to form full, grammatically elaborate sentences; instead, they preferred to rely on noun phrases denoting the requested concepts from the social insurance domain.",
        "Regarding the example, this does not come as a surprise as – apart from the additional cognitive effort which is required in using a complete sentence – using an NP seems to be a natural way of including the three dimensions of the specific personal information from the insurance records, the legal norms, and the lexical knowledge base in the noun phrase quoted above.",
        "In contrast, three complete sentences have to be formed to refer to the same dimensions if noun phrases are avoided.",

        "In contrast to this, the noun phrase 'exemption times because of child rais-ing' needs no metalanguage und points elliptically to all three dimensions.",
        "Therefore, if only noun phrases are used, their inherent vagueness and incompleteness at least provide means to consult all the relavant information sources simultaneously.",
        "For the NP analysis, this implies that much effort has to be invested in modelling the entities and relations denoted by the linguistic expressions, and certainly also the mapping between the linguistic and the conceptual levels.",
        "Tighly packed linguistic structures refer to complex conceptual structures.",
        "The dependencies in the conceptual model are mirrored in the linguistic expressions.",
        "As we are dealing with noun phrase queries, it is not possible to regard verbs as assigning the key structural dependencies.",
        "Yet it can be said that certain conceptually pivotal nouns 'subcategorize' (to use this term loosely for illustration purposes) for specific linguistic objects which are determined by the underlying conceptual data model as well as certain conventions of use.",
        "These 'subcategorization relations' are often confirmed by prepositions with weak semantics: Ersatzzeiten wegen Kindererziehung 'Exemption times because of child raising.' The function of the preposition is to indicate the relation.",

        "This implies that linguistic paraphrases which denote the same object or set of objects have to eventually end up in identical representations.",
