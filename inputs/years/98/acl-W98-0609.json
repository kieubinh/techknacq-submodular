        "Summary: In this paper we report on an exploration of noun-noun compounds in a large German corpus.",
        "The morphological parsing providing the analysis of words into stems and suffixes was entirely data-driven, in that no knowledge of Ge_:nan was used to determine what the correct set of stems and suffixes was, nor how to break any given word into its component morphemes.",
        "To discover compounds, however, we used our prior knowledge of the structure of German nominal compounds, in a way that we will describe in greater length below.",
        "The interest of this case derives from the fact that German compounds (unlike English compounds, but like those in many other languages, especially in the Indo-European family) include a linking element (Fugenelement in German) placed between the two stems.",
        "Traditional grammars report nine possible linker elements: e, es, en, er, n, ens, ns, s, and zero (see Duden 1995), and report as well that the Left Element determines which choice of linking element is appropriate for a given nominal compound.,"

        "One of the authors is currently developing a morphological analyzer that takes a large corpus as its input and returns a morphological analysis based on that corpus (see Goldsmith (in prep.)).",
        "Most of the morphological activity in European languages",
        "The general goal, then, was to implement a compound-analyzer in the context of the unsupervised acquisition of morphology.",

        "In general, the analyst cannot know whether a given language forms its compounds with fully inflected words or with stems (that is, inflected words minus the inflectional suffix), but the latter is by far the most common pattern.",
        "The challenge, then, is to determine whether an analysis of the non-compound words in a corpus will give rise to a sufficient inventory of stems (in the correct surface form, so to speak) so that actual compounds found in the corpus can be identified as concatenation of two such stems, possibly separated by a linker element chosen from a very small inventory.",
        "At the same time, it is critical that the analysis not over-recognize compounds, that is, that it not \"recognize\" compounds that are not there – an error that will typically arise if there exist true stems that are homographs of suffixes, or of subparts of suffixes.",
        "We have labelled this problem the Schweinerei problem (from Schweinerei \"mess\" [lit., pig + erei nominal derivational suffix]) because the word can be misanalyzed as a compound incorporating the linker er and the Right Element Ei \"egg\".",
        "In addition, the challenge of identifying compounds raises the question as to whether there is a clear distinction to be drawn (in",
        "German, and in other languages as well) between a (prefix + stem) structure and A compound (stem + stem) structure.",
        "Duden 1995, for example, characterizes one use of Haupt \"head\" as a prefix (e.g., in Hauptstadt \"capital\"), based, presumably, on the semantic bleaching that often accompanies long-time use of a word in various compounds.",
        "English has similar uses of the stem head, with cases ranging from head teacher, written with a space and in which the element head contributes a very clear semantics even though it has almost nothing to do with the original sense of head, all the way to headline, where the meaning of the word is barely, if at all, decomposable into two parts.",
        "In our work we have employed the definition of affix that is integrated into our automatic morphological analyzer, which is the following: after establishing a tentative set of candidate affixes, a set of affixes is identified which occurs with each given stem (a distinct set of prefixes and suffixes).",
        "If exactly the same set (of two or more suffixes) is used by two or more stems, then that set of affixes is \"approved\", and the affixes are definitively identified as affixes (rather than as compounds, for example)."

        "Compounding in German is common, ranging from the very frequent formation of compound nouns to the less common but also productive formation of compound verbs and adjectives.2 Multiseg,mented compounds, such as Anwendungsprogrammschnittstelle \"applications program interface\", can be viewed as recursively applied binary compounds ( [ (Anwendung \"application\" + Programm \"program\") + Schnittstelle \"interface\"] ).",
        "We will refer to the element on the left of such a binary structure as the Left Element, the element on the right as the Right Element, and the sequence of linking characters used to join the Left Element and Right Element as the Linker.3",

        "This effectively doubles the number of Linkers we consider, i.e. we add (e- es- en er n ens- ns- sand -) to our list.",
        "Duden 1995 reports that the hyphen is prescribed if the Left Element is an abbreviation and generally present if the Left Element is a proper name, and otherwise, it is generally employed to improve readability or to emphasize the individual components of the compound.",
        "Our actual results confirm some of these guidelines but also yield data that seem not to be covered by the guidelines.",
        "The leading hyphenated Left Elements in our data, for example, are (in order): US-, Tang-, and Ballett-.",
        "Ballett is neither an abbreviation nor a proper name, nor does it seem that it leads to especially unreadable compounds; nevertheless, it is near the top of the list.",
        "If the Left Element ends in the suffix – e or – en, this suffix is sometimes dropped (Schule \"school\" + Kind \"child\" = Schulkind \"schoolage child\")s. But there is another view of compounding in which no subtraction occurs.",

        "Furthermore, the stems returned by corpus processing can contain umlauts.",

        "In general, the choice of a Linker (as well as umlauting and desuffixing) is determined by the Left Element.7 Part-of-speech combinations of the Left Element and Right Element include noun-noun, noun-verb, verb-noun, adjective-noun, noun-adjective, etc.",
        "In this paper we are only concerned with noun-noun compounds, i.e. ones whose Left Element and Right Element are both lexicalized nouns.",

        "Our goals were formulated in the context of a system which must be equally robust in the context of analysis and generation; furthermore, we set out to obtain information that could be placed in our lexicon, but the analysis of compounds that we used did not need to be performed in real-time together with a user's speech or keyboard input.",

        "Since the object of our inquiry has been noun-noun compounds, and since German nouns are capitalized, we restricted our processing to words in the corpus beginning with a capital letter.",
        "We therefore first applied our automatic morphological analyzer to the First 300,000 capitalized words in Microsoft's Encarta, an encyclopedia, to establish a list of 8,426 noun stems.",
        "These are identified by first automatically extracting the productive suffixes in the corpus; 74 were identified, in frequency dominated by the top six' suffixes (en, e, er, s, ung, ii); see Table 1.11 When the algorithm identifies two distinct words as composed of the same stem followed by different suffixes, it accepts that stem as legitimate.",
        "For example, the string beobacht-(stem for \"watch\") is identified as a stem because it appears in the corpus with the following five suffixes: -en/ en / -ers/ -ung/ - ungen.",
        "In addition, if a potential stem occurs as a free-standing word, we consider that to count as an appearance of the stem with a null suffix.",
        "For example, the stem Alaska \"Alaska\" appears with 11 We note that four \"suffixes\" identified by this procedure are in fact from compounds: -land, - szentrum, -produktion, and – sgebiet.",
        "Given our algorithm for determing suffixes, it follows that such errors will occur less often as we move to larger corpora.",

        "Table 2 illustrates the fact that this procedure includes in our list of stems noun compounds that are found in the corpus with more than one suffix.",
        "This is not a problem, and in fact is a good thing, because, as we noted above, compounds are frequently recursively composed out of pieces which are themselves compounds.",
        "With this list of stems in hand, we revisit the original corpus, checking each entry now for the possibility of one or more parses as compounds.",
        "Given the set of linkers (established in advance, as we have noted), we can very simply review each word to see if it can be parsed as the concatenation of an item from the list of stems + one of the linkers + another item from the list of stems + one of the 74 recognized suffixes.",
        "All forms that can be so parsed are added to a list of compounds found; in our corpus, we found 5522 compounds, based on 3866 distinct First Element stems.",
