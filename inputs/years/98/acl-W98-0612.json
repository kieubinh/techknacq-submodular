        "Elsewhere (Rais-Ghasem, 1998), the first author has reviewed existing computational lexicon models and showed that, despite their differences, they all subscribe to the same meaning theory, namely sense enumeration (Seidenberg et al., 1982; Simpson and Burgess, 1985).",
        "Fundamental to this theory are two assumptions: 1) the possibility of listing or enumerating all possible meanings for each word, and 2) the existence of a selection process in which one of these meanings is selected for a given word.",
        "One of the main disadvantages of such enumerative lexicons is their inability to account for a phenomenon generally known as semantic flexibility (see Barclay et al., 1974; Barsalou, 1993; Greenspan, 1986).",
        "In short, semantic flexibility concerns changes that context causes in representation of concepts in memory.",
        "Many psycholinguistic findings have shown that context seems to highlight or obscure certain properties of a single concept as it appears in different contexts.",
        "For example, in an early experiment, Barclay et al.",
        "(1974) demonstrated how the interpretations of familiar, unambiguous words vary with context.",
        "For instance, they argued that the choice of attributes for piano is affected by the verb selection in The man (lifted) (tuned) (smashed) (sat on) (photographed) the piano.",
        "They then provided evidence that the prior acquisition of a sentence like The man lifted the piano (vs.",
        "The man tuned the piano) influences the effectiveness of cues like \"something heavy\" (vs. \"something with a nice sound\") in recall.",
        "They concluded that context can affect the encoding of concepts in memory.",
        "Similarly, Barsalou (1982) reported that subjects verify contextually relevant properties significantly faster than contextually irrelevant properties Witney et al.",
        "(1985) also report similar results.",
        "Their work is particularly interesting since they distinguished between two levels of property activation: 1) the functional level (useful in activities such as sentence comprehension and classification), and 2) the semantic access level (corresponding to the information that is actually accessed upon",
        "seeing a word).",
        "They used intervals of 0, 300 and 600 ms: and found that all properties of a word were initially activated (accessed), regardless of the context.",
        "However, the contextually irrelevant ('low-dominant' in their terminology) properties would die off rapidly, and hence play a negligible role in the overall sentence comprehension.",
        "Greenspan (1986) studied the effect of sentential context on concrete nouns.",
        "He examined the presence of central and peripheral properties of a noun in different contexts.",
        "For a given a noun, Greenspan presented his subjects with a pair of sentences where in each sentence a different type of properties was emphasized.",
        "For example, consider the noun basket.",
        "Being a container is a central property for basket whereas being made of straw is a peripheral one.",
        "Each of the following sentences focuses on one of these properties.",
        "The butler placed the letter in the basket.",
        "(Container) Sally took several days to weave the basket.",
        "(Straw) Later he examined subjects' recall in various memory tasks and found that the central properties were activated regardless of the context, but peripheral properties were activated only if they were emphasized by the sentence.",
        "He further showed that the emphasized central properties were more activated than unemphasized central properties.",
        "He concluded that the interpretation of a concrete noun is a function of both the sentential context and the noun's central properties (Ibid.).",
        "Anderson et al.",
        "(1976) demonstrated that general terms are contextually instantiated to more specific terms.",
        "For example, they used fish in contexts like the following sentences and hypothesized that it was likely to be instantiated respectively to goldfish, trout and shark.",
        "The grocer stared at the fish in the bowl.",
        "The grocer stared at the fish in the stream.",
        "The fish attacked the swimmer.",
        "They examined their hypothesis in a number of experiments and found that an expected instantiated term was a better cue for the recall of a sentence then the general term itself, even though the general term had appeared in the sentence and the particular term had not.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing computational lexicon models have adequately dealt with semantic flexibility.",
        "Having subscribed to the sense enumeration theory, the effects of context in these models are limited to selecting of one sense.",
        "Any changes in the characteristics of a selected sense either has to come in the form of a new sense or is ignored.",
        "This requires the ability to foresee any context that a word can appear in and define a separate sense for it.",
        "Obviously, this is impractical, if not impossible (see Corriveau, 1995, chapter 2).",
        "Thus, any lexicon model must support a combination of sense generation and sense selection.",
        "Of the various computational lexicon models, this issue is specially problematic for symbolic lexicons (e.g., Dyer, 1982; Wilensky, 1978) and lexicons based on semantic networks (Lange & Dyer, 1989; Waltz & Pollack, 1985).",
        "This is due to the fact that word senses in these models are coded as discrete entries.",
        "Owing to their adopted continuous representation, connectionist models, however, are potentially capable of dealing with contextual effects at a finer level.",
        "In fact McClelland and Kawamoto (1986) reported an unintended yet interesting result.",
        "They had presented their model with The ball broke the vase.",
        "Although throughout the training ball was always associated with the microfeature soft, in the output it was associated with the microfeature hard.",
        "They attributed this result to the fact that breakers in their experiment were all hard and the model had shaded the meaning of ball accordingly.",
        "However, the connectionist approach also has some disadvantages.",
        "First of all, connectionist lexicons presuppose a set of universal and fixed microfeatures and demand that every sense be characterized in terms of such rnicrofeatures in advance.",
        "This constitutes a serious problem for any real world application.",
        "But what is even more important is the difficulty to separate patterns of contextual effects from the representation of a word sense.",
        "For instance, consider breakers in McClelland and Kawamoto (1986).",
        "It is impossible to examine this category of objects by itself.",
        "Thus we cannot determine 1) what qualifies an object to be a breaker or 2) what else can be a breaker?",
        "We believe separating patterns of contextual effects from internal representations of context is important.",
        "Firstly, such patterns can be thought of as ad hoc categories, categories built by people to achieve goals (Barsalou, 1983).",
        "For instance, the breakers category can be instrumental in achieving the goal of \"breaking a window\".",
        "Secondly, from a learning point of view, such patterns can be very useful.",
        "Rais-Ghasem (1998) has shown how a concept can evolve (i.e., acquires new properties) from such",
        "patterns as it appears in various contexts.",
        "Also, Rais-Ghasem (Ibid.)",
        "has employed such patterns to implement a metaphor understanding system that interprets metaphors as class inclusion assertions (see Gluksberg & Keysar, 1990)."

        "Sense selection happens in cases of lexical ambiguity where one sense is chosen among a number of contrastive senses (see Pustejovsky, 1995) associated with a word.",
        "In sense modulation, the semantic characteristics of a selected sense are modulated according to its surrounding context.",
        "Cruse describes two types of sense modulation: a) highlighting or backg.rounding, and b) promotion or demotion of features.",
        "In the former, context underlines certain aspects (i.e., properties) of the concept selected for a given word while dimming others, as it happens for piano in the following examples: The musician played the piano.",

        "While the sense-concept tier specifies the core meaning of a word in a given context, the sense-view tier specifies how this meaning is to be viewed in that context.",

        "Each property is also accompanied with a number between 0 and 1 indicating the property's weight (or centrality) in a given sense-view.",
        "The implemented system relies on the Mikrokosmos ontology (Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1995) to specify properties for sense-concepts and sense-viewsl.",
