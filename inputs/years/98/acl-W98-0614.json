        "Meaning shifting phenomena such as metonymy have recently attracted increasing interest of researchers.",
        "Computational methods addressing these phenomena aim at inferring implicitly represented relations, predicting meaning shifts of nouns or verbs, expressing restrictions on these meaning shifts in dependency of context or language-specific factors, and facilitating reference resolution.",
        "Measurements to achieve these issues include representation of default knowledge, and various sorts of dedicated inference methods and constructive procedures.",
        "However, the entities in the texts examined almost always appear in singular form so that issues of cardinality of metonymically related items have been widely ignored by the approaches undertaken so far.",
        "Motivated by this lack of analysis, we have examined sentences taken from the literature about metonymic phenomena, and we have modified them by varying cardinalities of the items appearing explicitly or implicitly, to analyze effects of these alternations.",
        "The results have inspired us to undertake extensions to other techniques, such as lexical representations, to build increasingly explicit versions of logical forms, and to formulate conditions on pronominal accessibility, The insights gained are likely to improve analysis methods for metonymic expressions, especially for relating contextual specifications to the appropriate entity, and for supporting reference resolution to entities related implicitly.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we review major computational approaches to metonymy.",
        "Then we illustrate the phenomena investigated by a number of typical examples.",
        "We continue by elaborating techniques to deal with these phenomena, that is, an enhancement to entries in the Generative Lexicon, and a procedure for building a logical form that appropriately represents relevant aspects of metonymic expressions.",

      "text": [
        "Metonymy belongs to a variety of natural language phenomena that contribute to expressing information in an effective and economic way.",
        "All these phenomena involve what has been termed 'transfers of meaning' by (Nunberg, 1995), i.e., the meaning of some constituent does not correspond to what can usually be expected according to the syntactic and semantic environment.",
        "Metonymy, or semantic coercion, is usually defined as a figure of speech in which the speaker is \"using one entity to refer to",
        "abduction process to find the best explanation for the observables'.",
        "These approaches work nicely for analyzing utterances of the kind considered by inserting a plausible relation to remove a constraint violation, and they have similar and characteristic properties:",
        "• The conditions expressing when leaving a metonymic relation implicit or not is possible are too unconstrained to cover a larger number of examples in several languages.",
        "• The entities involved, the real and the literal referent, always appear in singular form.",
        "There are only two approaches which in some aspects deviate from this characterization: • Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1991) addresses the first aspect.",
        "He proposes a Theory of Qualia within a",
        "Generative Lexicon, which enables the explanation of systematic polysemy.",
        "Applying type coercion enables one to arrive at cases of ordinary metonymy which can be grounded in terms of the semantics of lexemes, as well as at word senses which Pustejovsky has termed logical metonymy, like the reading of a book in the sentence \"Mary enjoyed the book\".",
        "Enhancing the semantic representation of a noun within such contexts is done by exploiting prototypical knowledge derived from AGENTIVE or TELIC roles of the lexical entry for 'book', which are prominent roles in the Qualia Structure of lexical entries for nouns.",
        "The accuracy of the theory has been extended by the incorporation of restrictions on the productivity of lexemes.",
        "Particularities of the Qualia Structure of nouns regulate the acceptability or unacceptability of leaving a metonymic relation implicit in context of the words engaged (McDonald, Busa 1994, Pustejovsky, Bouillon 1995).",
        "• (Stallard 1993) indirectly addresses the second aspect by taking into account scoping relations and consequences for pronominal reference.",
        "He has introduced a distinction between referential and predicative metonymy, depending on whether the actual or the literal argument is accessible for subsequent pronominal reference.",
        "This distinction manifests itself in different scope relations that hold between the actual and the literal argument in the corresponding logical forms.",
        "Though we do not agree with his usage of scoping and the resulting strict distinction of pronominal accessibility, Stallard's approach to build logical forms has inspired our techniques.",
        "Though neither Pustejovsky's nor Stallard's approach address the role of cardinalities, we show that both of them can be extended accordingly: the Generative Lexicon can be augmented to represent knowledge about cardinality information associated with the semantics of nominals, and techniques similar to those used by Stallard can be set up for building logical forms with more precise cardinality specifications of the metonymically related entities.",
        "But before we expose these methods in detail, we prepare the ground for this enterprise by discussing a set of sentences illustrating the phenomena we intend to investigate."

        "For other metonymic relations, especially PART for WHOLE and ORGANIZATION for MEMBER, a number of complications may arise due to the cardinality of the items involved in a metonymic expression, as the following examples demonstrate.",
        "Let us start with two contrastive sentences (1) and (2), taken from (Hobbs et al.",

        "We challenge this analysis in its strict sense, but we agree with it insofar as pronominal references as in (lb) or (2a) are rare, but quite common in sentences such as (la) and (2b).",

        "In contrast to that, the verb and possessive pronouns in German appear in strict agreement with the literal referents in the corresponding sentences (4\") to (6\").",
        "Altogether, English sentences of this sort are more conclusive by making cardinalities and, in case of singular, also gender of the intended referent explicit, while the German sentences are ambiguous in these respects.",

        "Finally, sentences (6') to (6b) constitute further pieces of evidence that default expectations about the cardinality of metonymically related entities (here, persons as eaters of kinds of food) play a certain role as to whether pronominal reference to metonymic expressions is felicitous or not, but not in a strict sense.",
        "In addition, (6b) is probably more common than (6a) as a default, due to the pragmatics of paying and plausibilities about table sharing, especially about food sharing according to reasonably assumed food quantities, seem to influence felicity in a subtle, hardly generalizable way in these sorts of sentences.",
        "For a member of a group as in (3b) (one of the pizza eaters), the pragmatics of paying (a single person on behalf of several ones) may even license the use of the singular form as in (3a).",

        "The example sentences demonstrate certain complications in metonymic uses of 'office' in contrast to metonymic uses of 'sandwich', which originate from the differences in the underlying relations between food and the persons eating it, as opposed to the office and the caller who is related in a more indirect or perhaps more pronounced way to the office than persons are to the food they eat.",
        "Plural pronominal references as in sentences (7b), (7c), (8b) and (8c) are felicitous, but there is a difference between the sets of entities the plural pronouns refer to.",
        "While in (7c) and (8c), the pronouns refer to the entire set of employees of the Boston office, they more plausibly refer to the representatives in the meeting in (7b) and to the excursion participants in (8b).",
        "In any case, these examples indicate an additional demand on the treatment of cardinalities and referential accessibility of metonymic expressions: a distinction is to be made between the entities referred to metonymically (here: employees of the Boston office), and those of its member involved in the event expressed by the sentence (here: the meeting and the excursion).",

        "However, relating these two entities directly by an employment relation is problematic, since it is impossible to connect the locality information (from Boston to New York) and the first class restriction to either of them.",
        "Linking this information to the airline would decontextualize the serving process, and linking it to the persons would make the serving process independent of the context of a flight and the person's working for the airline.",
        "Therefore, it is more appropriate to elaborate the relation between the airlines and their employees to include the implicitly referred flights explicitly.",
        "These flights, of course, are the items that are first class and go from Boston to New York.",

        "In this paper, we have presented an approach to deal with cardinality aspects of metonymic extensions to nouns.",
        "We have discussed a variety of constellations with pronominal references to implicitly related items, sometimes associated with subtle conditions, including cross-language differences between English and German.",
        "In order to build explicit logical forms with cardinality specifications, we have extended entries in Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon by default quantifier specifications, and we have described methods for exploiting these entries accordingly: Metonymic extensions are introduced on the basis of events represented in the roles of the Qualia structure, and member or subset relations are introduced on the basis of the associated quantifier specification.",
        "Our method for building explicit logical forms challenges Stallard's distinction of predicative and referential readings of metonymic expressions: it produces different scopings that reflect proper quantifier dominance relations rather than pronominal accessibility conditions, and it allows for additional cases of pronominal reference.",
        "In addition, our method enables a more precise attachment of contextual specifications to related entities, and it yields a better basis for reference resolution to metonymically related entities."
