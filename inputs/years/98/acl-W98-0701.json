        "This paper presents a new general supervised word sense disambiguation method based on a relatively small syntactically parsed and semantically tagged training corpus.",
        "The method exploits a full sentential context and all the explicit semantic relations in a sentence to identify the senses of all of that sentence's content words.",
        "In spite of a very small training corpus, we report an overall accuracy of 80.3% (85.7, 63.9, 83.6 and 86.5%, for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, respectively), which exceeds the accuracy of a statistical sense-frequency based semantic tagging, the only really applicable general disambiguating technique."

        "In most cases the correct word sense can be identified using only the words co-occurring in the same sentence.",
        "However, very often we also need to use the context of words that appear outside the given sentence.",
        "For this reason we distinguish two types of contexts: the sentential context and the discourse context.",
        "The sentential context is given by the words which co-occur with the word in a sentence and by their relations to this word, while the discourse context is given by the words outside the sentence and their relations to the word.",
        "The problem that arises here is that most of the co-occurring words are also polysemous, and unless disambiguated they cannot fully contribute to the process of disambiguation.",
        "The senses of these words, however, also depend on the sense of the disambiguated word and therefore there is a reciprocal dependency which we will try to resolve by the algorithm described in this paper."

        "For our work, we used the word sense definitions as given in WordNet (Miller, 1990), which is comparable to a good printed dictionary in its coverage and distinction of senses.",
        "Since WordNet only provides definitions for content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), we are only concerned with identifying the correct senses of the content words.",
        "Both for the training and for the testing of our algorithm, we used the syntactically analysed sentences of the Brown Corpus (Marcus, 1993), which have been manually semantically tagged (Miller et al., 1993) into semantic concordance files (SemCor).",
        "These files combine 103 passages of the Brown Corpus with the WordNet lexical database in such a way that every content word in the text carries both a syntactic tag and a semantic tag pointing to the appropriate sense of that word in WordNet.",
        "Passages in the Brown Corpus are approximately 2,000 words long, and each contains approximately 1,000 content words.",
        "The percentages of the nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in the semantically tagged corpus, together with their average number of Word Net senses, are given in Table I.",
        "Although most of the words in a dictionary are monosemous, it is the polysemous words that occur most frequently in speech and text.",
        "For example, over 80% of words in WordNet are monosemous, but almost 78% of the content words in the tested corpus had more than one sense, as shown in Table 2.",
        "Assigning the most frequent sense (as defined by WordNet) to every content word in the used corpus would result in an accuracy of 75.2 %.",
        "Our aim is to create a word sense disambiguation system for identifying the correct senses of all content words in a given sentence, with an accuracy higher than would be achieved solely by a use of the most frequent sense."

        "The aim of the system described here is to take any syntactically analysed sentence on the input and assign each of its content words a pointer to an appropriate sense in WordNet.",
        "Because the words in a sentence are bound by their syntactic relations, all the word's senses are determined by their most probable combination in all the syntactic relations derived from the parse structure of the given sentence.",
        "It is assumed here that each phrase has one central constituent (head), and all other constituents in the phrase modify the head (modifiers).",
        "It is also assumed that there is no relation between the modifiers.",
        "The relations are explicitly present in the parse tree, where head words propagate up through the tree, each parent receiving its head word from its head-child.",
        "Every syntactic relation can be also viewed as a semantic relationship between the concepts represented by the participating words.",
        "Consider, for example, the sentence (1) whose syntactic structure is given in Figure 1.",
        "(1) The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place.",
        "Each word in the above sentence is bound by a number of syntactic relations which determine the correct sense of the word.",
        "For example, the sense of the verb produced is constrained by the subject-verb relation with the noun investigation, by the verb-object relation with the noun evidence and by the subordinate clause relation with the verb said.",
        "Similarly, the verb said is constrained by its relations with the words Jury, Friday and produced; the sense of the noun investigation is constrained by the relation with the head of its prepositional phrase - election, and by the subject-verb relation with the verb produced, and so on.",
        "The key to extraction of the relations is that any phrase can be substituted by the corresponding tree headword (links marked bold in Figure I).",
        "To determine the tree headword we used a set of rules similar to that described by (Magerman, 1995)(Je-linek et al., 1994) and also used by (Collins, 1996), which we modified in the following way:",
        "• The head of a prepositional phrase (PP--p IN NP) was substituted by a function the name of which corresponds to the preposition, and its sole argument corresponds to the head of the noun phrase NP.",
        "• The head of a subordinate clause was changed to a function named after the head of the first element in the subordinate clause (usually 'that' or a 'NULL' element) and its sole argument corresponds to the head of its second element (usually head of a sentence).",
        "Because we assumed that the relations within the same phrase are independent, all the relations are between the modifier constituents and the head of a phrase only.",
        "This is not necessarily true in some situations, but for the sake of simplicity we took the liberty to assume so.",
        "A complete list of applicable relations for sentence (1) is given in (2).",
        "Each of the extracted syntactic relations has a certain probability for each combination of the senses of its arguments.",
        "This probability is derived from the probability of the semantic relation of each combination of the sense candidates of the related content words.",

        "This paper presents a new general approach to word sense disambiguation.",
        "Unlike most of the existing methods, it identifies the senses of all content words in a sentence based on an estimation of the overall probability of all semantic relations in that sentence.",
        "By using the semantic distance measure, our method reduces the sparse data problem since the training examples and their contexts do not have to match the disambiguated words exactly.",
        "All the semantic relations in a sentence are combined according to the syntactic structure of the sentence, which makes the method particularly suitable for integration with a statistical parser into a powerful Natural Language Processing system.",
        "The method is designed to work with any type of common text and is capable of distinguishing among many word senses.",
        "It has a very wide scope of applicability and is not limited to only one part-of-speech."
