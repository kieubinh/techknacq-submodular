        "WSD that make use of the information pro",
        "vided by machine readable dictionaries (Cowie et al.1992), (Miller et al.1994), (Agirre and Rigau, 1995), (Li et al.1995), (NIcRoy, 1992);",
        "2.",
        "WSD that use information gathered from training on a corpus that has already been semantically disambiguated (supervised training methods) (Gale, Church et al., 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996); 3.",
        "WSD that use information gathered from raw corpora (unsupervised training methods) (Yarowsky 1995) (Resnik 1997).",
        "There are also hybrid methods that combine several sources of knowledge such as lexicon information, heuristics.",
        "collocations and others (NIcRoy, 1992) (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) (Ng and Lee, 1996) (Rigau, Asterias et al., 1997).",
        "Statistical methods produce high accuracy results for small number of preselected words.",
        "A lack of widely available semantically tagged corpora almost excludes supervised learning methods.",
        "On the other hand, the disambiguation using unsupervised methods has the disadvantage that the senses are not well defined.",
        "To our knowledge, none of the statistical methods disambiguate adjectives or adverbs so far.",
        "One approach to WSD is to determine the conceptual distance between words, that is to measure the semantic closeness of the words within a semantic network.",
        "Essentially, it is the length of the shortest path connecting the concepts (Rada et al.1989), (Rigau.",
        "Asterias et al., 1997).",
        "By measuring the conceptual distance between words, it is possible to determine the likelihood of word sense associations.",
        "For example, the method proposed in (Li et al.1995) tries to determine the possible sense of a noun associated with a verb using WordNet and a large text.",
        "Based on other occurrences of the verb or semantically related verbs in the text, the possible object is determined by measuring the semantic similarity between the noun objects.",
        "Methods that do not need large corpora are usually based exclusively on MRD.",
        "A proposal in this sense has been made in (Agirre and Rigau.",
        "1995): they measure the conceptual density between nouns, by using WordNet, but the method proposed in their paper cannot be applied to measuring a conceptual distance between a verb and a noun, as no direct links are provided in NIRDs between the nouns and verbs hierarchies.",
        "A WordNet-based method for measuring the semantic similarity between nouns was also proposed in (Richardson et al.. 1994).",
        "Their method consists of using hierarchical concept graphs constructed from WordNet data files, and a semantic similarity formula.",
        "Still, the method does not provide a link between different part-of-speech words."

      "heading": "2 Our approach",
      "text": [
        "The approach described in this paper is based on the idea of semantic density.",
        "This can be measured by the number of common words that are within a semantic distance of two or more words.",
        "The closer the semantic relationship between two words the higher the semantic density between them.",
        "The way it is defined here, the semantic density works well in the case of uniform MRD.",
        "In reality there are gaps in the knowledge representations and the semantic density can provide only an estimation of the actual semantic relatedness between words.",
        "We introduce the semantic density because it is",
        "relatively easy to measure it on a MRD like WordNet.",
        "This is done by counting the number of concepts two words have in common.",
        "A metric is introduced in this sense which when applied to all possible combinations of the senses of two or more words it ranks them.",
        "Another idea of this paper is to use the Internet as a raw corpora.",
        "Thus we have two sources of information: (1) the Internet for gathering statistics and (2) WordNet for measuring semantic density.",
        "As will be shown below, a ranking of words senses results from each of these two sources.",
        "The issue now is how to combine these two rankings in order to provide an overall ranking.",
        "One possibility is to use them in parallel and the other one is to use them serially.",
        "We have tried both and the serial approach provided better results.",
        "Thus, for a verb - noun pair, the WSD method consists of two Algorithms, the first one ranks the noun senses, of which we retain only the best two senses; and a second Algorithm takes the output produced by the first Algorithm and ranks the pairs of verb - noun senses.",
        "Extensions of this method to other pairs than verb - noun are discussed, and larger windows of more than two words are considered.",
        "An essential aspect of the WSD method presented here is that we provide a raking of possible associations between words instead of a binary yes/no decision for each possible sense combination.",
        "This allows for a controllable precision as other modules may be able to distinguish later the correct sense association from such a small pool.",
        "WordNet is a fine grain MRD and this makes it more difficult to pinpoint the correct sense combination since there are many to choose from and many are semantically close.",
        "For applications such as machine translation, fine grain disambiguation works well but for information extraction and some other applications this is an overkill, and some senses may be lumped together.",
        "A simple sentence or question can usually be briefly described by an action and an object; for example, the main idea from the sentence He has to investigate all the reports can be described by the action-object pair investigate-report.",
        "Even the phrase may be ambiguous by having a poor context, still the results of a search or interface based on such a sentence can be improved if the possible associations between the senses of the verb and the noun are determined.",
        "In WordNet (Miller 1990), the gloss of a verb synset provides a noun-context for that verb, i.e. the possible nouns occurring in the context of that particular verb.",
        "The glosses are used here in the same way a corpus is used.",
        "In order to improve the precision of determining the conceptual density between a verb and a noun, the senses of the noun should be ranked, such as to indicate with a reasonable accuracy the first possible senses that it might have.",
        "The approach we considered for this task is the use of unsupervised statistical methods on large texts.",
        "The larger the collection of texts, the bigger is the probability to provide an accurate ranking of senses.",
        "As the biggest number of texts electronically stored - and thus favoring an automatic processing - is contained on the Web, we thought of using the Internet as a source of corpora for ranking the senses of the words.",
        "This first step of our method takes into consideration verb-noun pairs V – N, and it creates pairs in which the verb remains constant, i.e. V, and the noun is replaced by the words in its similarity lists.",
        "Using WordNet, a similarity list is created for each sense of the noun, and it contains: the words from the noun synset and the words from the noun hy-pernym synset."

        "We wed also the query form (b), but the results we obtained have been proved to be similar; using the operator NEAR, a bigger number of hits is reported, but the sense ranking remains the same.",

        "This research investigates a probabilistic realization of spreading activation to resolve interdependent word-sense ambiguities.",
        "The core idea is to exploit belief propagation in Bayesian networks: Words are mapped to nodes, lexical relations are mapped to edges, and evidence is propagated from word senses to other related word senses.",
        "The lexical relations are derived from an existing knowledge source, because this information cannot be automatically extracted from training data with existing techniques.",
        "The knowledge source we use is the WordNet is-a hierarchy, i.e., the hypernym/hyponym taxonomy (Miller, 1990).",
        "Although this hierarchy was developed for other purposes, it",
        "has been frequently applied to word-sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995; Sussna, 1993).",
        "In this work, we investigate various approaches to constructing a Bayesian network representation of the is-a hierarchy for use in word-sense disambiguation.",
        "As this work continues, other relations such as part/whole and entailment relations will also be included in the network.",

        "Statistical approaches to word-sense disambiguation have had the most success to date, when evaluated on unseen test data.",
        "The \"analytical\" Bayesian network component of our method is actually built on top of \"empirical\" probabilistic classifiers induced statistically from training data.",
        "In particular, an empirical classifier is induced for each word in the current sentence to be disambiguated (i.e., for each target word).",
        "Each empirical classifier is developed independently of the empirical classifiers for other target words.",
        "A Bayesian network is constructed from the segment of the WordNet is-a hierarchy that is connected to the target words.",
        "The results of the empirical classifiers are fed as evidence into the Bayesian network, thus initiating belief propagation.",

        "Conditional independence relationships simplify the formulation of the joint distribution making it possible to work with a large number of variables.",
        "Further, models that characterize conditional independence relationships have desirable computational properties (e.g., see the discussion on decomposable models in (Pearl, 1988)).",
        "These properties form the basis of the evidence propagation scheme used for Bayesian networks discussed in Section 7.",

        "Sussna (1993) produces a semantic network based on several different WordNet relations.",
        "His disambiguation method minimizes the pairwise distance among senses via a weighting scheme that accounts for both fanout and depth in the hierarchy.",

        "Voorhees (1993) describes an unsupervised approach that exploits the WordNet hypernym taxonomy.",
        "In particular, the hierarchy for a given word is automatically partitioned so that the words occurring in the synsets of a partition (or hood) only occur with one of the senses for the word.",
        "Disambiguation is based on the selecting the hood which has the highest estimated relative frequency for the context relative to training text.",
        "Resnik (1995) also describes an unsupervised approach that is based on estimating synset frequencies.",
        "As with Voorhees, the estimated frequency of a synset is based on the frequency of the word plus the frequencies of all its descendant synsets in a large corpus.",
        "Therefore, the top-level synsets have the highest frequencies and thus the highest estimated frequency of occurrence.",
        "For each pair of nouns from the text to be disambiguated, the most-informative-subsumer is determined by finding the common ancestor with the highest information content, where information content is inversely related to frequency.",
        "Then each noun is disambiguated by selecting the synset that receives the most support (i.e., information content) from the all of the most-informative",
        "subsumers.",
        "Eizirik et al.",
        "(1993) also describe a Bayesian network model for word-sense disambiguation, which includes syntactic disambiguation as well as lexical information.",
        "However, their networks are not automatically constructed."
