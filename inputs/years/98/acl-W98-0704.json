        "Development of WordNet began in 1985 at Princeton University (Miller, 1990).",
        "A team lead by Prof. George Miller aimed to create a source of lexical knowledge whose organization would reflect some of the recent findings of psycholinguistic research into the human lexicon.",
        "WordNet has been used in numerous natural language processing, such as part of speech tagging (Segond et al., 97), word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1995), text categorization (Gomez-Hidalgo and Rodriguez, 1997), information extraction (Chai and Biermann, 1997), and so on with considerable success.",
        "However the usefulness of WordNet in information retrieval applications has been debatable.",
        "Information retrieval is concerned with locating documents relevant to a user's information needs from a collection of documents.",
        "The user describes his/her information needs with a query which consists of a number of words.",
        "The information retrieval system compares the query with documents in the collection and returns the documents that are likely to satisfy the user's information requirements.",
        "A fundamental weakness of current information retrieval methods is that the vocabulary that searchers use is often not the same as the one by which the information has been indexed.",
        "Query expansion is one method to solve this problem.",
        "The query is expanded using terms which have similar meaning or bear some relation to those in the query, increasing the chances of matching words in relevant documents.",
        "Expanded terms are generally taken from a thesaurus.",
        "Obviously, given a query, the information retrieval system must present all useful articles to the user.",
        "This objective is measured by recall, i.e. the proportion of relevant articles retrieved by the system.",
        "Conversely, the information retrieval system must not present any useless article to the user.",
        "This criteria is measured by precision, i.e. the proportion of retrieved articles that are relevant.",
        "Voorhees used WordNet as a tool for query expansion (Voorhees, 1994).",
        "She conducted experiments using the TREC collection (Voorhees and Harman, 1997) in which all terms in the queries were expanded using a combination of synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms.",
        "She set the weights of the words contained in the original query to 1, and used a combination of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 2 for the expansion terms.",
        "She then used the SMART Information Retrieval System Engine (Salton, 1971) to retrieve the documents.",
        "Through this method, Voorhees only succeeded in improving the performance on short queries and a little with no significant improvement for long queries.",
        "She further tried to use WordNet as a tool for word sense disambiguation (Voorhees, 1993) and applied it to text retrieval, but the performance of retrieval was degraded.",
        "Stairmand (Stairmand, 1997) used WordNet to compute lexical cohesion according to the method suggested by Morris (Morris and Hirst, 1991), and applied this to information retrieval.",
        "He concluded that his method could not be applied to a fully-functional information retrieval system.",
        "Smeaton (Smeaton and Berrut, 1995) tried to expand the queries of the TREC-4 collection with various strategies of weighting expansion terms, along with manual and automatic word sense disambiguation techniques.",
        "Unfortunately all strategies degraded the retrieval performance.",
        "Instead of matching terms in queries and documents, Richardson (Richardson and Smeaton, 1995) used WordNet to compute the semantic distance between concepts or words and then used this term distance to compute the similarity between a query and a document.",
        "Although he proposed two methods to compute semantic distances, neither of them increased the retrieval performance."

        "We run exact-match retrieval against 9 small standard test collections in order to observe this phenomenon.",
        "An information retrieval test collection consists of a collection of documents along with a set of test queries.",
        "The set of relevant documents for each test query is also given, so that the performance of the information retrieval system can be measured.",
        "We expand queries using a combination of synonyms, hypernyras, and hyponyms in WordNet.",
        "The results are shown in Table 1.",
        "In Table 1 we show the name of the test collection (Collection), the total number of documents (#Doc) and queries (#Query), and all relevant documents for all queries (#Rel) in that collection.",
        "For each document collection, we indicate the total number of relevaRt_ documents retrieved (Rel-ret), the recall nel-ret the total number of documents retrieved (Ret-docs), and the precision (RReetl-cgt ) for each of no expansion (Base), expansion with synonyms (Exp.",

        "III), and expansion with synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms (Exp.",
        "IV).",
        "From the results in Table 1, we can conclude that query expansion can increase recall performance but unfortunately degrades precision performance.",
        "We thus turned to investigation of why all the relevant documents could not be retrieved with the query expansion method above.",
        "Some of the reasons are stated below :",
        "• Two terms that seem to be interrelated have different parts of speech in WordNet.",
        "This is the case between stochastic (adjective) and statistic (noun).",
        "Since words in WordNet are grouped on the basis of part of speech in WordNet, it is not possible to find a relationship between terms with different parts of speech.",
        "• Most of relationships between two terms are not found in WordNet.",
        "For example how do we know that Sumitomo Bank is a Japanese company ?",
        "• Some terms are not included in WordNet (proper name, etc).",
        "To overcome all the above problems, we propose a method to enrich WordNet with an automatically constructed thesaurus.",
        "The idea underlying this method is that an automatically constructed thesaurus could complement the drawbacks of WordNet.",
        "For example, as we stated earlier, proper names and their interrelations among them are not found in WordNet, but if proper names and other terms have some strong relationship, they often cooccur in the document, so that their relationship may be modelled by an automatically constructed thesaurus.",
        "Polysemous words degrade the precision of information retrieval since all senses of the original query term are considered for expansion.",
        "To overcome the problem of polysemous words, we apply a restriction in that queries are expanded by adding those terms that are most similar to the entirety of query terms, rather than selecting terms that are similar to a single term in the query.",

        "If two terms often cooccur together in a document then those two terms are likely bear some relationship.",
        "Why not only use the automatically constructed thesauri ?",

        "For example, consider the words tumor and tumour.",
        "These words certainly share the same context, but would never appear in the same document, at least not with a frequency recognized by a cooccurrence-based method.",
        "In general, different words used to describe similar concepts may never be used in the same document, and are thus missed by the cooccurrence methods.",
        "However their relationship may be found in the WordNet thesaurus.",
        "The second point is our weighting method.",
        "As already mentioned before, most attempts at automatically expanding queries by means of WordNet have failed to improve retrieval effectiveness.",

        "That is, they have no underlying justification.",
        "The advantages of our weighting method are:",
        "• the weight of each expansion term considers the similarity of that term with all terms in the original query, rather than to just one or some query terms.",
        "• the weight of the expansion term accommodates the polysemous word problem.",
        "This method can accommodate the polysemous word problem, because an expansion term taken from a different sense to the original query term sense is given very low weight.",
        "The reason for this is that, the weighting method depends on all query terms and all of the thesauri.",
        "For example, the word bank has many senses in WordNet.",
        "Two such senses are the financial institution and the river edge senses.",
        "In a document collection relating to financial banks, the river sense of bank will generally not be found in the cooccurrence-based thesaurus because of a lack of articles talking about rivers.",
        "Even though (with small possibility) there may be some documents in the collection talking about rivers, if the query contained the finance sense of bank then the other terms in the query would also concerned with finance and not rivers.",
        "Thus rivers would only have a relationship with the bank term and there would be no relationships with other terms in the original query, resulting in a low weight.",
        "Since our weighting method depends on both query in its entirety and similarity in the three thesauri, the wrong sense expansion terms are given very low weight."
