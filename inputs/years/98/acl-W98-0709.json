        "One of the main issues in last years as regards NLP activities is the increasingly fast development of generic language resources.",
        "A lot of such resources, including both software and lingware items (lexicons, lexical databases, grammars, corpora marked in several ways) have been made available for research and industrial applications.",
        "Special interest presents, for knowledge-based NLP tasks, the availability of wide coverage ontologies.",
        "Most known ontologies (as GUM, CYC, ONTOS, MICROKOSMOS, EDR or WORDNET, see [Gomez 98] for an extensive survey) differ in great extent on several characteristics (e.g. broad coverage vs. domain specific, lexically oriented vs. conceptually oriented, granularity, kind of information placed in nodes, kind of relations, way of building, etc.).",
        "It is clear, however, that for a wide range of applications, WordNet (WN) [Miller 90] as become a de-facto standard.",
        "The success of WordNet has determined the emergence of several projects that aim the construction of WordNets for other languages than English (e.g., [Hamp & Feldweg 971, [Artale et al.",
        "97]) or to develop multilingual WordNets (the most important project in this line is EuroWordNet (EWN)1).",
        "ihttp://www.let.uva.n1/-ewn/ The aim of EWN project is to build a multilingual database with WordNets for The construction of a WN for a language Lg (LgWN) can be tackled in different ways according to the lexical sources available.",
        "Of course the manual construction can be undertaken quite straightforwardly and leads to the best results in terms of accuracy, but has the important drawback of its cost.",
        "So, other approaches have been carried out taking profit of available resources in fully automatic or semi-automatic ways.",
        "Which are these lexical resources?",
        "Basically four kinds of resources have been used: 1) English WN (EnWN), as an initial skeleton for trying to attach the words of Lg to it, 2) already existing taxonomies of Lg (both at word and at sense level), 3) bilingual (English and Lg) and 4) monolingual (Lg) dictionaries.",
        "All the approaches using EnWN as skeleton are based on the assumption of a close conceptual similarity between English and Lg, in such a way that most of the structure (relations) in EnWN could be maintained for LgWN.",
        "In the case of bilingual dictionaries the usual approach is to try to link the English counterpart of entries to synsets in EnWN and to assume that the entry can be linked to the same synset Monolingual dictionaries have been used basically as a source for extracting taxonomic (hypemym) links between words (or senses [Bruce & Guthrie 921, [Rigau et al.",
        "97]) and in lower extent for extracting other kinds of semantic relations [Richardson 97] (e.g. meronymic links).",
        "Once a taxonomy of Lg (already existing or built from a monolingual MRD) is available, the task can consist of 1) enriching the taxonomic structure with other semantic links (manually or automatically), as is the case of building individual WNs, or 2) merging this structure with other already existing ontologies (as EnWN or EWN).",
        "This paper presents our approach to the construction of WNs for two languages, Spanish and Catalan, and linking the first one to EWN.",
        "We have developed a methodology that uses as core source EnWN2.",
        "The methodology implies 1) several european languacpes (in the first phase, Dutch, Italian and Spanish in ad tion to English).",
        "We have used WordNet 1.5.",
        "The use of EnWN for guiding the selection of the basic concepts of our WNs, 2) the use of EnWN as skeleton for linking Spanish and Catalan words to English synsets using bilingual dictionaries, 3) the use of EnWN, together with bilingual and monolingual dictionaries for allowing the construction of taxonomies (at sense level) of our languages and 4) the use of EnWN together with already built fragments of SpWN and OWN for merging and incorporating these taxonomies to our WNs.",
        "In section 2 an overall description of our approach is given.",
        "Sections 3,4 and 5 focus on the procedures for extracting connections between words/senses/synsets.",
        "Section 3 is devoted to procedures based on the use of bilinguals, section 4 on the construction of taxonomies and section 5 deals with the merging method.",

        "The general approach for building EWN is described in 1Vossen et al.",
        "971 Roughly speaking, the approach follows a top-down strategy trying to assure a high level of overlapping between languages, at least in the highest levels of the hierarchy, but reflecting the language-specific lexicalizations and providing the maximum of freedom and flexibility for building the individual WordNets.",
        "Basically it consists of three major steps: 1) Construction of core-WordNets for a set of common base concepts (around 800 nouns and 200 verbs), 2) enrichment of these sets providing relational links and incorporating their direct semantic contexts and 3) top-down extension of these core-WordNets.",
        "In our case two different approaches have been followed for dealing with nouns and verbs3.",
        "In the case of verbs most of the work has been performed manually.",
        "The main source of information has been the Pirapides database 1CastellOn et al.",
        "971 that consists of 3,600 English verbs forms organized around Levin's Semantic Classes connected to WN1.5 senses.",
        "The database contains the theta-Grids specifications for each verb (its semantic structure in terms of cases or thematic roles), translation to Spanish and Catalan forms4 and diathesis information.",
        "The connections extracted from this database were cross-validated with the information provided by bilingual dictionaries in order to improve their accuracy.",
        "In the case of nouns we have followed EWN strategy in the next way: 1) The two highest levels of EnWN (top concepts and direct hyponyms) were manually translated into Spanish (including variants).",
        "The results were filtered dropping out words appearing less than five times as genus terms in our monolingual dictionary PGILE 871 or occurring less than 50 times in DGILE definition corpus5 and less than 100 times in LEXESP corpus°.",
        "This initial set (Spanish core concepts, 361 synsets) was then compared with base concept sets of other sites of EWN (roughly the union of intersection pairs between languages was considered as the common base concepts set).",
        "The missing concepts in Spanish were manually added and vertically bottom up extended leading to the common Base Concept set (around 800 synsets).",
        "Catalan Base Concepts set was then built to cover the Spanish Base Concepts set.",
        "2) The enrichment of the BC set has been performed in two steps.",

        "We have therefore assumed that the structure of the WN taxonomy would suffice in the earlier stages of the construction of the our WNs.",
        "So, we need to choose synonyms in Spanish7 for the English words present in the original syrtsets of WN.",
        "One way to fulfil our requirements is using bilingual dictionaries (see [Knight & Luk 941, [Okumura & Hovy 94]).",
        "But we have to perform a sense disambiguation task in order to know which sense of both words (the Spanish and the English one) is being referred.",
        "In other words, we have to decide, for which sense of the Spanish word and for which synset in WordNet a relation of synonymy is being defined.",
        "There is also another minor problem to overcome, the unification of the two directions of the bilingual dictionary, which in few cases are symmetrical, to collect all translations together.",
        "It is true that unifying both directions of the bilingual dictionary implies loss of information potentially important (e.g. the order in which translations are written is relevant).",
        "But the lack of systematic work in the construction of the bilinguals makes this information of very doubtful utility.",
        "Thus, we have processed the bilinguals creating what we have called the homogeneous bilingual, which is a bilingual with both directions mixed.",
        "Then, for each Spanish word, we have collected all the words given as correct translations.",
        "And this has been the source for our work of attachment of Spanish words to WordNet synsets.",
        "Having collected all the translations of a Spanish word together, we have then classified the words in classes depending on their behaviour.",
        "They can be classified in three dimensions: polysemy, structural and conceptual.",
        "In the polysemy dimension, we classify the words in classes depending on the number and kind of translations.",
        "For example, all entries that have only one translation fall in the same class when this translation is monosemous in WN terms; all entries that have several translations fall in another class when these translations are polysemous.",
        "In the structural dimension, we classify the words in classes depending on the relation that the translations owns in WN.",
        "For example, all entries which have several translations, sharing some of them a common synset in WN, fall in the same category; all entries in which one translation is a direct hyponym of other translation fall in the same category, etc.",
        "In the conceptual dimension, we apply the conceptual distance formula (which is explained in section 4.2.1.)",
        "on elements of the entries.",
        "For example, all entries with a low conceptual distance between synsets of their translations fall in the same class.",
        "Each of these classes defines a set of entries with the same behaviour.",
        "A confidence score has been assigned to each class by means of a manual validation of a significant sample extracted from them.",
        "We decided to accept the classes with a precission of 85% or more as classes of words to include in the first version of SpWN.",
        "Bilinguals can be used a step further stating a supposition: when several methods give the same result for the same Spanish word, the confidence for this attachment increases.",
        "We have carried out an experiment checking the classes in pairs, evaluating the precission of the set of intersections, and in all cases the precission increased.",
        "We have removed the cases where the precision was over 85%, the threshold applied in the previous experiment.",
        "This caused an increment of 40% of the original set of attachments.",
        "Furthermore, it is clear that if we merge more bilinguals, the homogeneous resulting will be larger, and will then generate larger classes.",
        "But, what is even more important, the classes are more precise because some bilinguals lack the inclusion of some translations for some words.",
        "Table 1 shows the current figures of both CtWN and SpWN following this approach (see [Atserias et al.",
        "971 and [Benitez et al.",
        "98] for further details of the whole process and tools used).",
        "The last point to address is the extension of the intersection method to larger number of classes.",
        "If with two classes the intersection increased the confidence an equivalent increase when 7 Although we ilustrate the methodology considering only S_panish, we performed the whole process for both Catalan and Spanish (and we provide results for both).",
        "intersecting larger numbers of classes can be expected.",
        "As a matter of fact, the extension of the intersection method would be nothing more than performing a multivariant statistical analysis, where each of the classes would be a factor.",
        "The interesting result of this multivariant analysis would be a formula which could be used to calculate the value of the confidence of an attachment, depending on the number of classes in which it occurs."

        "An approach for building in a fast and automatic way substantial fragments of WordNets have been presented.",

        "The system has been applied to build Spanish WordNet (within the framework of EuroWordNet) and Catalan WordNet.",
        "First, following [Atserias et aL 97], we applied a set of complementary techniques for linlcing Spanish and Catalan words collected from a bilingual MRDs (for nouns) and lexicons (for verbs) to English WordNet.",
        "Second, by applying the methodology described in section 4 we are able to build up accurate taxonomies from monolingual MRDs (see [Itigau et al.",
        "97] and [Rigau et al.",
        "98]).",
        "Third, taking profit of both lexical resources (the sparse connections produced by the first methodology and the taxonomies produced by the second) we have presented a novel bootstrapping methodology for covering substantial parts of the new WordNets not covered previously."
