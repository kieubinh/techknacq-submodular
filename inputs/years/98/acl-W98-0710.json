      "text": [
        "Lexical resources used in natural language processing (NLP) have evolved from handcrafted lexical entries to machine readable lexical databases and large corpora which allow statistical manipulation.",
        "The availability of electronic versions of linguistic resources was a big leap.",
        "Among these resources we find conventional dictionaries as well as thesauri.",
        "However, it does not often suffice to depend on any single resource, either because it does not contain all required information or the information is not organised in a way suitable for the purpose.",
        "Merging different resources is therefore necessary.",
        "Calzolari's (1988) Italian lexical database, Knight and Luk's (1994) PANGLOSS ontology, and Klarans and Tzoukermann's (1995) bilingual lexicon are some responses to this need.",
        "Many attempts have also been made to transform the implicit information in dictionary definitions to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amster, 1981; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow et al., 1985; Markowitz et al., 1986; Klavans et al., 1990; Vossen and Copestalce, 1993).",
        "Nonetheless, dictionaries are also infamous for their non-standardised sense granularity, and the taxonomies obtained from definitions are inevitably ad hoc.",
        "It would therefore be a good idea if we could integrate such information from dictionaries with some existing, and widely exploited, classifications such as the system in Roget's Thesaurus (Roget, 1852), which has remained intact for years.",
        "We can see at least the following ways in which an integration of lexical resources would be useful in NLP:",
        "• Most NLP functions, notably word sense disambiguation (WSD), need to draw information from a variety of resources and cannot sufficiently rely on any single resource.",
        "• When different systems of sense tagging are used in different studies, we need a common ground for comparison.",
        "Knowing where one sense in one resource stands in another would enable better evaluation.",
        "• In attempting integration, we can discover how one resource differs from another and thus identify their individual limitations.",
        "This can guide improvement of the resources.",
        "An approach to the integration problem is offered by WordNet.",
        "WordNet is designed to enable conceptual search (Miller et al., 1993), and therefore it should provide a way of linking word level senses as those in dictionaries with semantic classes as those in thesauri.",
        "However, one important question is whether WordNet, a psycholinguistically-based resource, will work the same way as conventional linguistic resources do.",
        "We can divide this question into two parts.",
        "First, we are interested in how similar the sense discrimination is in WordNet and in a conventional dictionary.",
        "Second, WordNet has a classificatory structure, but the principle of classification is somehow different from that of a thesaurus.",
        "As a result, terms which are close in a thesaurus, thus allowing contextual sense disambiguation, may be found further apart in the WordNet taxonomy, which may therefore not be informative enough.",
        "For example, \"car\" and \"driver\" are located in two different branches in the WordNet hierarchy and the only way to relate them is through the top node \"entity\".",
        "This fails to uncover the conceptual closeness of the two",
        "words as Roget's Thesaurus does, for they are put in adjacent semantic classes (\"Land travel\" and \"Traveller\" respectively).",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that there must be some relation between the classes in WordNet and those in a thesaurus, which provides some means for us to make an association between them.",
        "We have therefore proposed an algorithm to link up the three kinds of resources, namely a conventional dictionary, WordNet and a thesaurus.",
        "This is made possible with the WordNet taxonomic hierarchy as the backbone because traversing the hierarchy gives many kinds of linking possibility.",
        "The resulting integrated information structure should then serve the following functions:",
        "• enhancing the lexical information in a dictionary with the taxonomic hierarchy in WordNet, and vice versa • complementing the taxonomic hierarchy in WordNet with the semantic classification in a thesaurus, and vice versa",
        "We have carried out an experiment, using the algorithm, to map senses in a dictionary to those in WordNet, and those in WordNet to the classes in a thesaurus.",
        "Our aim has been to (i) assess the plausibility of the algorithm, and to (ii) explore how the various resources differ from one another.",
        "The results suggest that mappings are in general successful (i.e. when links can be made, they are appropriate) while failures mostly arise from the inadequacy of individual resources.",
        "Based on these findings, we have also proposed some ways to overcome such inadequacies.",
        "The algorithm is described in the next section.",
        "The test materials and the design are given in Section 3.",
        "The results are presented in Section 4.",
        "They are analysed and discussed in Section 5, where we also suggest some ways to apply them."

        "The three lexical resources we used are the 1987 revision of Roget's Thesaurus (ROGET) (Kirkpatrick, 1987), the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978) and the Prolog version of WordNet 1.5 (WN) (Miller et al., 1993).",
        "The linking of LDOCE and WN is in principle quite similar to Knight and Luk's (1994) approach in the PANGLOSS project.",
        "But our form of comparison between LDOCE and WN, motivated by the organisation of individual resources in relation to one another, was simpler but as effective.",

        "Basically if it was not, it would mean that words are treated too differently in terms of sense distinction in different resources for the mapping to succeed.",

This measure reflects the granularity of the senses in the source resource (S) with respect to those in the target resource ('fl, and is defined as follows:",
