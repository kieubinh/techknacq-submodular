        "It's an understatement that lexicon acquisition is a costly endeavor.",
        "Traditional dictionaries have been developed over the course of decades through the employment of many lexicographers and numerous consultants.",
        "Furthermore, the development of semantic lexicons incurs additional cost for the explicit encoding of meaning representations that provide details often omitted in traditional dictionaries, which are written for humans not computers.",
        "Atkins (1995) estimates that it would take 100 person-years to properly develop a semantic lexical database comparable in scope to a standard college dictionary.",
        "Lexicons are a key component of machine translation systems (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994).",
        "The Mikrokosmos (pK) project at NMSU's Computing Research Laboratory is developing Spanish, Chinese and Japanese lexicons to support knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT).",
        "The following table indicates the amount of effort that was required for developing the initial Spanish lexicon entries from scratch (Viegas et al.. 1996): 6798 word-sense entries (as of 29 Mar 1996) Average of 1.2 meaning per word form Acquisition rate: 45 entries/day per person Acquisition effort: 4 person years Like many research centers, we don't have the human resources to construct the entire lexicons manually, so we are investigating several different ways to automate lexicon acquisition.",
        "Viegas et al.",
        "(1996) discuss one approach at this through the use of lexical rules, such as for generating the morpho-semantic derivatives of Spanish verbs.",
        "A natural solution would be to take advantage of machine readable dictionaries (MRD's), such as Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE).",
        "This approach was popular in the eighties; however, it achieved mixed success.",
        "See (Wilks et al., 1996) for a comprehensive survey of MRD research.",
        "One of the main problems is that dictionaries aren't explicit about the particular senses of the words used in definitions.",
        "In addition, much knowledge of the world is assumed by the dictionary entries.",
        "Consider the second LDOCE sense of the noun \"whistle\" (Procter, 1978): whistle, n. ... 2. the high sound made by passing air or steam through a small tube-shaped area, either an instrument, a mouth, or a beak Obviously, \"air\" does not mean musical melody, even though this is closer to the topic area of the definition than the gas-mixture sense.",
        "Note also that the definition assumes the reader knows what the actual sound is like and just needs to know enough to distinguish it from similar sounds, such as from a flute.",
        "As indicated in (Nirenburg, 1994), relying solely on MRD's will not yield a lexicon sufficient for realistic applications.",
        "These need to be fortified with machine-readable versions of other reference sources, such as thesauri, collocation lists, and perhaps even encyclopedias.",
        "Furthermore, text corpora from the",
        "specific application domain should be used for training and testing.",
        "In the Mikrokosmos project, this type of information has been consulted during the development of the language-independent ontology, most of which was created manually (Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1995).",
        "Therefore, it is conceivable to automate much of the lexical acquisition by mapping entries from MRD's into concepts from the ontology.",
        "As long as a word being defined is a simple refinement of a concept present in the ontology, this mapping forms the basis of the lexical representation, which can then be refined manually if necessary.",
        "The work reported here demonstrates the feasibility of this approach by mapping entries from Princeton's WordNet (Miller, 1990) into our ontology.",
        "Like a thesaurus, WordNet is structured around groups of synonymous words.",
        "In WordNet these groups are called synsets and are taken as indistinguishable in particular contexts.",
        "Like a dictionary, it provides definitions and usage examples.",
        "However, unlike both, it provides explicit relationships among the synsets (e.g, is-a and has-a).",
        "Thus WordNet also represents an explicit ontology of concepts, provided that word senses are considered as concepts.",
        "It is this lexicalized ontology that facilitates mapping the WordNet senses (i.e., synsets) for a English word into the corresponding concept in the Mikrokosmos ontology.",
        "Note that there are several reasons why mapping directly from the WordNet synset to the equivalent in a particular foreign language is undesirable.",
        "The main reason is that mapping into a language-neutral ontology facilitates richer text meaning representations that are not tied to the specifics of particular languages.",
        "For more details on this and other benefits of KBMT see (Nirenburg et al., 1992)."

      "heading": "1.2 Overview of the Solution",
      "text": [
        "Overall, the algorithm is fairly straightforward and incorporates few domain-specific dependencies.",
        "To begin with, the mapping algorithm does not perform parsing or pattern matching of the definition entries but instead relies on the conventions used in the ontology development.",
        "For instance, the names of concepts use the corresponding English word whenever possible; in cases where no English word provide a suitable label, the name is based on the concept's parent label (e.g., VOLUNTARY-PERCEPTUAL-EVENT, a kind of PERCEPTUAL-EVENT).",
        "Therefore, when a word from a synset and a AK concept name are the same or just slight variations, there is a good chance that the same concept is being referred to.",
        "The control mechanism thus is a generate-and-test cycle applied to each AK concept: generate words potentially in WordNet synsets and test the senses of these for the best matches with the Mikrokosmos concept.",
        "The algorithm incorporates two main heuristics that exploit the WordNet ontology hierarchy.",
        "One specifically assigns the highest weight to the potential synset/concept mapping which has the highest degree of overlap between the respective is-a hierarchies.",
        "For instance, when mapping to the concept DOG, the canine sense of \"dog\", which goes through MAMMAL and to ENTITY, is preferred over the scoundrel sense, which goes through PERSON to ENTITY.",
        "The other heuristic uses synset frequencies, estimated from a corpus of Wall Street Journal articles.",
        "This is based on a technique for disambiguating noun groups using WordNet by Resnik (1995).",
        "For each pair of defining words that share a common ancestor, the support for the match is increased by an amount inversely proportional to the frequency of the ancestor, because unrelated words only have common ancestors at the top level of the hierarchy.",
        "Two other heuristics exploit the ontology but in a more localized manner.",
        "One assigns a weight based on the degree of overlap among the children for each concepts.",
        "The other does the same thing for the siblings of each.",
        "The final heuristic computes the degree of overlap among the words in the definition texts.",
        "This was meant mainly as a weak supplement to the others to help discriminate close mappings, but it turned out to be more accurate than the other localized heuristics.",
        "In cases where a fully-automated system might not be considered robust enough for a particular application domain, this approach can easily be adapted to an interactive one.",
        "In this case, the main benefit would be that the human lexicographer can be relieved of much of the tedious aspects of the English lexicon development.",
        "Specifically, the matching of new words against concepts in the ontology can be done automatically, along with providing definition glosses and examples.",
        "Therefore, the lexicographer can concentrate on filling in the details necessary to realize the lexical entry."

        "In contrast, the lexicon contains just the information needed to realize a concept in a given language (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994).",
        "It will contain the usual information about morphology and syntax; but, most of the semantics will be defined in terms of a concept from the ontology.",
        "Therefore, the semantics for the lexicon entry might just be a direct mapping to the associated",
        "concept.",
        "This is illustrated in the lexical entry for \"book\" in figure 1.",
