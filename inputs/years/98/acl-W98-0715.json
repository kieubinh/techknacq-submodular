        "WordNet (Miller, 1990) has been used as a general resource of broad-coverage lexical information in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including sense tagging, text summarization and machine translation.",
        "However, like other large-scale knowledge-base systems or machine readable dictionaries (MRDs), WordNet contains massive ambiguity and redundancy.",
        "In particular, since WordNet senses are more fine-grained than most other MRDs such as LDOCE (Procter, 1978), each word entry is more ambiguous.",
        "For example, WordNet 1.6 (released December 1997) lists the following 9 senses for the verb write:",
        "1. write, compose, pen, indite - produce a literary work 2. write - communicate or express by writing 3. publish, write - have (one's written work) issued for publication 4. write, drop a line - communicate (with) in writing 5. write - communicate by letter 6. compose, write - write music 7. write - mark or trace on a surface 8. write - record data on a computer 9. spell, write - write or name the letters",
        "These fine sense distinctions may not be desired in some applications.",
        "Consequently any system which incorporates WordNet without customization must presume this redundancy, and may need to control the ambiguities in order to make the computation tractable.",
        "Although the redundancy in WordNet could be a drawback, it can be an ideal resource for a broad-coverage domain-independent semantic lexicon based on underspecified semantic classes (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998).",
        "An underspecified semantic class is an abstract semantic type which encodes systematic polysemy (or regular polysemy (Apresjan, 1973)):1 a set of word senses that are related in systematic and predictable ways (eg.",
        "INSTITUTION and BUILDING meanings of the word school).",
        "These related word senses are grouped together, and assigned an abstract semantic class that generalizes the relation.",
        "This way, we do not need to distinguish or disambiguate word senses that encompass several semantic \"axes\", and we can regard an underspecified class as a multidimensional semantic entity.",
        "This abstract class is underspecified because it does not specify either one of the member senses.",
        "Here, in building a lexicon based on such underspecified semantic classes, redundancy in WordNet is a desirable property since the amount of information lost by abstraction is minimized.",
        "Also, since WordNet sense entries are taken from general but wide range of domains, systematic polysemy can be extracted from the dictionary rather than from a sense-tagged corpus.",
        "Therefore, data sparseness problems become less significant.",
        "Then, the resulting lexicon can effectively compact the redundancy and ambiguity in WordNet by two dimensions: abstraction and systematic polysemy.",
        "The use of underspecified semantic classes is one of the underspecificatzon techniques being investigated in recent years (van Deemter and Peters.",
        "'Note that systematic polysemy should be contrasted with homonymy which refers to words which have more than one unrelated sense (eg.",
        "FINAN-CIAL_INSTITUTION and SLOPING_LAND meanings of the word bank).",
        "1996).",
        "This underspecified class has several advantages.",
        "First, it can compactly represent the ambiguity which arises from multiple related senses.",
        "Thus it is more expressive and computationally efficient than single sense representations.",
        "Second, it can facilitate abductive inference through the sys-tematicity between senses: given a word with n related senses, the identification of one sense in a context can imply maximally all n senses, some of which may only be implicit in the context.",
        "In addition, when two systematically polysemous words are used together, the combination enables even more powerful inferences through a complex matching between the two sets of systematic relations.",
        "Then, a domain-independent broad-coverage lexicon defined by such abstract underspecified classes can be used as a background lexicon in domain-specific reasoning tasks such as Information Extraction (Kilgarriff, 1997), or as a general semantic lexicon for parsing, as well as for many other NLP tasks that require contextual inferences.",
        "However, automatic acquisition of systematic polysemy has been a difficult task.",
        "In fact, in most previous work in lexical semantics it is done manually (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998).",
        "In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method of inducing underspecified semantic classes from WordNet verbs and nouns.",
        "The method first applies a statistical analysis to obtain a rough approximation of the sense dependencies found in WordNet.",
        "Incorrect dependencies are then manually filtered out.",
        "Although the approach is not fully automated, it provides a principled way of acquiring systematic polysemy from a large-scale lexical resource, and greatly reduces the amount of manual effort that was previously required.",
        "Furthermore, by having a manual intervention, the results will be able to reflect our prior knowledge about WordNet that was not assumed in the statistical analysis.",
        "To see the usefulness of the induced semantic classes in the contextual inferences of real-world texts, predicate-argument structures are extracted from Brown corpus, and the occurrences of such classes are observed."

        "This definition excludes meanings obtained by cross-categorical alternations (eg.",
        "denominals) or morphological alternations (eg.",
        "suffixing with -ify), or homonyms or metaphors, and includes only the senses of the word of the same category and form that have some systematic relations.",
        "For example, INSTITUTION and BUILDING meanings of the word school are systematically polysemous because BUILDING relates to INSTITUTION by the location of the institution.",
        "For nouns, each polysemous sense often refers to a different object.",
        "In the above example, school as INSTITUTION refers to an organization, whereas school as BUILDING refers to a physical object.",
        "On the other hand, for verbs, polysemous senses refer to different aspects of the same action.",
        "For example, a word write in the sentence \"John wrote the book\" is ambiguous between CREATION (of the book) and COMMUNICATION (through the content of the book) meanings.",
        "But they both describe the same action of John writing the particular book.",
        "Here, these two meanings are systematically related by referring to the causation aspect (CREATION) or the purpose aspect (COMMUNICATION) of the write action.",
        "This view is largely consistent with the entailment relations (temporal inclusion and causation) used to organize WordNet verb taxonomies (Fellbaum, 1990).",
        "Another assumption we made is the dependency between related senses.",
        "In the work in this paper, sense dependency is viewed as sense extension, similar to (Copestake and Briscoe.",

        "This assumption is in accord with lexical rules (Copestake and Briscoe, 1995; Ostler and Atkins, 1992), where meaning extension is expressed by if-then implication rules.",
        "In the above example of the noun school, INSTITUTION meaning is considered as the primary and BUILDING as the secondary, since institutions are likely to have office space but building may be occupied by other entities besides institutions.",
        "Similarly for the verb write, CREATION is considered as the primary and COMMUNICATION as the secondary, since communication takes place through the object that is just produced but communication can take place without producing an object."

        "Therefore,\" the first step in the induction is to select a set of abstract senses that are useful in capturing the sys-tematicity.",
        "To this end, WordNet is a good resource because word senses (or synsets) are organized in taxonomies.",
        "Ideally, basic types should be semantically orthogonal, to function essentially as the \"axes\" in a high-dimensional semantic space.",
        "Good candidates would be the top abstract nodes in the WordNet taxonomies or lexicographers' file names listed in the sense entries.",

        "The advantage of this automatic analysis here is two fold: not only it discovers/reveals the semantic type associations with respect to the basic types selected from the previous step, it also helps the manual filtering to become more informed and consistent than by judging with mere intuition, since the result is based on the actual content of WordNet.",
        "The type dependency graph is constructed in the following way.",

        "Then, these associations are manually inspected to create a directed type dependency graph in the next phase.",

        "ANI – FOOD in nouns).",
        "As a heuristic to detect the false negatives, we used the cross-categorical inheritance in the taxonomies in which category switches as the hierarchy is traversed up.",
        "The direction of the associations are determined by sense extension described in section 2.",
        "In addition, we used the ontological generality of the basic types as another criteria.",

        "For instance, the verb category CHA (change) is ontologically general, and may occur with specific types in entailment relation.",

        "In order to prevent this kind of implausible inference, we restricted the direction of a systematic relation to be from the specific type to the general type, if one of the member types is the generalization of the other.",
