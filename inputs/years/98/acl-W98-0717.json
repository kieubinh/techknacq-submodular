        "A variety of inductive learning techniques have been used in recent years in natural language processing.",
        "Given a large training corpus as input and relying on statistical properties of language usage, statistics-based and machine learning algorithms are used to induce a classifier which can be used to resolve a disambiguation task.",
        "Applications of this line of research include ambiguity resolution at different levels of sentence analysis: part-of speech tagging, word-sense disambiguation, word selection in machine translation, context-sensitive spelling correction, word selection in speech recognition, and identification of discourse markers.",
        "Many natural language inferences, however, seem to rely heavily on semantic and pragmatic knowledge about the world and the language, that is not explicit in the training data.",
        "The ability to incorporate knowledge from other sources of information, be it knowledge that is acquired across modalities, prepared by a teacher or by an expert, is crucial for going beyond low level natural language inferences.",
        "Within Machine Learning, the use of knowledge is often limited to that of constraining the hypothesis space (either before learning or by probabilistically biasing the search for the hypothesis) or to techniques such as EBL (DeJong, 1981; Mitchell et al., 1986; DeJong and Mooney, 1986) which rely on explicit domain knowledge that can be used to explain (usually, prove deductively) the observed examples.",
        "The knowledge needed to perform language-understanding related tasks, however, does not exist in any explicit form that is amenable to techniques of this sort, and many believe that it will never be available in such explicit forms.",
        "An enormous amount of useful \"knowledge\" may be available, though.",
        "Pieces of information that may be found valuable in language-understanding related tasks may include: the root form of a verb; a list of nouns that are in some relation (e.g., are all countries) and can thus appear in similar contexts; a list of verbs that can be followed by a food item; a list of items you can see through, things that are furniture, a list of dangerous things, etc.",
        "This rich collection of information pieces does not form any domain theory to speak of and cannot be acquired from a single source of information.",
        "This knowledge is noisy, incomplete and ambiguous.",
        "While some of it may be acquired from text, a lot if it may only be acquired from other modalities, as those used by humans.",
        "We believe that integration of such knowledge is essential for NLP to attain high-level natural-language inference.",
        "Contrary to this intuition, experiments in text retrieval and natural language have not shown much improvement when incorporating information of the kind humans seem to use (Krovetz and Croft, 1992: Kosmynin and Davidson, 1996; Karov and Edelman,",
        "1996; Junker, 1997).",
        "The lack of significant improvement in the presence of more \"knowledge\" may be explained by the type of knowledge used, the way it is incorporated, and the learning algorithms employed.",
        "In the present paper we study an effective way of incorporating incomplete and ambiguous information sources of the abovementioned type within a specific learning approach, and focus on the knowledge sources that can be effective in doing so.",
        "The long-term goal of our work is understanding (1) what types of knowledge sources can be used for performance improvement, and at what granularity level and (2) which computational mechanisms can make the best use of these sources.",
        "In particular, the effect of noun-class information on learning Prepositional Phrase Attachment (PPA, cf. Sec. 2) is studied.",
        "This problem is studied within SNOW, a sparse architecture utilizing an on-line learning algorithm based on Winnow (Little-stone, 1988).",
        "That algorithm has been applied for natural language disambiguation tasks and related problems and perform remarkably well (Golding and Roth, 1996; Dagan et al., 1997; Roth and Zelenko, 1998).",
        "The noun-class data was derived from the WordNet database (Miller, 1990) which was compiled for general linguistic purposes, irrespective of the PPA problem.",
        "We derived the classes at different granularities.",
        "At the highest level, nouns are classified according to their synsets.",
        "The lower levels are obtained by successively using the hypernym relation defined in WordNet.",
        "In addition, we use the Corelex database (Buitelaar, 1998).",
        "Consisting of 126 coarse-grained semantic types covering around 40,000 nouns, Corelex defines a large number of systematic polysemous classes that are derived from an analysis of sense distributions in WordNet.",
        "The results indicate that a statistically significant improvement in performance is achieved when the noun-class information is incorporated into the data.",
        "The absolute performance achieved on the task is slightly better than other systems, although it is still significantly worse than the performance of a human subject tested on this task.",
        "The granularity of the class information appears to be crucial for improving performance.",
        "The addition of too many overlapping classes does not help performance, but with fewer classes - the improvement is significant.",
        "In addition to semantic information, using classes carries with it some structural information.",
        "A class feature may be viewed as a disjunction of other features, thereby increasing the expressivity of the hypothesis used for prediction.",
        "In order to control for the possibility that the performance improvements seen are due mainly to the structural information, we generated random classes.",
        "Some of these had exactly the same distribution over the original features as do the semantic classes.",
        "Surprisingly, we find that a non-negligible part of the improvement is due merely to the structural information, although most of it can be attributed to the semantic content of the classes.",
        "Along with promoting work on the incorporation of problem-independent incomplete knowledge into the learning process, the encouraging results with incorporating noun-class data provide a motivation for carrying out more work on generating better linguistic knowledge sources.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: we start by presenting the task, PPA and the SNOW architecture and algorithm.",
        "In section 4 we describe the classes and present the main experiments with the semantic and random classes.",
        "Section 5 concludes."

        "Nodes in the first layer of the network represent the input features; target nodes are represented by nodes in the second layer.",
        "Links from the first to the second layer have weights; each target node is thus defined as a (linear) function of the lower level nodes.",
        "For example, in PPA, the two target nodes represent n and v attachments.",
        "Each target node can be thought of as an autonomous subnetwork, although they all feed from the same input.",
        "The subnetworks are sparse in that a target node needs not be connected to all nodes in the input layer.",
        "For example, it is not connected to input nodes (features) that were never active with it in the same example, or it may disconnect itself from some of the irrelevant inputs while training.",
        "Learning in SNOW proceeds in an on-line fash-ion'.",
        "Every example is treated autonomously by each target subnetwork, viewed as a positive example of a few subnetworks and a negative example for the others.",
        "In PPA, examples labeled n (v, resp.)",
        "are treated as positive for the n (v) target node and as negative for the v (n) target node.",
        "Thus, every example is used once by all the nodes to refine their definition, and then discarded.",
        "At prediction time, given an input which activates a subset of the input nodes, each subnetwork evaluates the total activity it receives.",
        "Subnetworks compete on determining the final prediction; the one which produces the highest activity gets to determine the prediction.",
        "In general, a target node in the SNOW architecture is represented by a collection of subnetworks, which we call a cloud, but in the application described here we have used cloud size of 1 so this will not be discussed here.",
        "The Winnow local mistake-driven learning algorithm (Littlestone, 1988) is used at each target node to learn its dependence on the input nodes.",
        "Winnow updates the weight on the links in a multiplicative fashion.",
        "We do not supply the details of the algorithm and just note that it can be implemented in I In the experimental study we do not update the network while testing.",
        "such a way that the update time of the algorithm depends on the number of active features in the example rather than the total number of features in the domain.",
        "The sparse architecture along with the representation of each example as a list of active features is reminiscent of infinite attribute models of Winnow (Blum, 1992).",
        "Theoretical analysis has shown that multiplicative update algorithms, like Winnow, have exceptionally good behavior in the presence of irrelevant attributes, noise, and even a target function changing in time (Littlestone, 1988; Littlestone and War-rnuth, 1994; Herbster and Warmuth, 1995).",
        "In particular, Winnow was shown to learn efficiently any linear threshold function (Littlestone, 1988), with a mistake bound that depends on the margin between positive and negative examples.",
        "The key feature of Winnow is that its mistake bound grows linearly with the number of relevant attributes and only logarithmically with the total number of attributes n. In particular, Winnow still maintains its abovemen-tioned dependence on the number of total and relevant attributes even when no linear-threshold function can make a perfect classification (Littlestone, 1991; Kivinen and Warmuth, 1995).",
        "Even when there are only two target nodes and the cloud size is 1, the behavior of SNOW is different from that of pure Winnow.",
        "While each of the target nodes is learned using a positive Winnow algorithm, a winner-take-all policy is used to determine the prediction.",
        "Thus, we use the learning algorithm here in a more complex way than just as a discriminator.",
        "One reason is that the SNOW architecture, influenced by the Neuroidal system (Valiant, 1994), is being used in a system developed for the purpose of learning knowledge representations for natural language understanding tasks, and is being evaluated on a variety of tasks for which the node allocation process is of importance.",
        "We have experimented extensively with various architectures of SNOW on the EPA problem but can present in this paper only a small part of these experiments.",
        "The best performance, across a few parameter sets and data, is achieved with a full architecture.",
        "In this case we initially link a target node to all features which occur in the training (with a constant initial value), and only then start training.",
        "Since training in SNOW is always done in an on-line fashion - each example is used only once for updating the weights, and only if a mistake on it was made."

        "In the highest level, denoted by WN1, nouns are classified according to their synsets.",
        "The lower levels are obtained by successively using the hypemym relation defined in WordNet.",
        "Thus, WN2 is obtained by replacing each WNI synset with the set of hypernyrns to which it points, WN3 – by performing a similar process on the WN2 hypernyrns, etc.",

        "As mentioned above, giving up the original feature yielded degraded results.",
        "The results of adding features from a single knowledge source, presented in Table 2, show that FF have yielded small improvements over the lemma set, within the noise-level; the WN1 synset information caused a slight degradation, and the CL and other WN knowledge resulted in a significant improvement over the lemma case.",
        "An important property of the CL class information is that each CL class defines a distinct set of nouns, as each noun belongs to one CL class.",
        "The synset (WN1) distribution differs greatly from that of the CL classes; each noun may belong to a few synsets – allowing more potential conflicts.",
        "That property of the synset distribution gives rise to the performance degradation.",

        "There are around 60000 synsets, whereas there are only 126 CL classes.",
        "The finer synset granularity means that a synset carries less information; thus, the CL classes add richer disjunctions than WN synsets do.",

        "Nevertheless, since each number-word (e.g., \"one\", \"two\", etc.)",

        "The results are presented in Table 3, comparison with Table 2 shows that augmenting with FF knowledge yielded a slight improvement only for the CL set.",
        "There may be two explanations for that: (i) the CL classes are more appropriate for the PPA problem than the WN hypernyms, therefore the FF information fit with less conflicts.",
        "(ii) The coverage of CL nouns is about 70% that of WN for the test data (cf. Table 1), therefore there are more examples in which the CL and FF classes do not conflict.",
