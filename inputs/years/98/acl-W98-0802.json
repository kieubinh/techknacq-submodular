        "This paper argues for the usefulness of multimodal spoken language corpora and specifies components of a platform for the creation, maintenance and exploitation of such corpora.",
        "Two of the components, which have already been implemented as prototypes, are described in more detail: TransTool and SyncTool.",
        "TransTool is a transcription editor meant to facilitate and partially automate the task of a human transcriber, while SyncTool is a tool for aligning the resulting transcriptions with a digitized audio and video recording in order to allow synchronized presentation of different representations (e.g., text, audio, video, acoustic analysis).",
        "Finally, a brief comparison is made between these tools and other programs developed for similar purposes."

        "The availability of adequate tools for the creation, maintenance and use of multimodal spoken language corpora is an important instrumental goal for spoken language research, whether this research is motivated primarily by the desire to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of spoken communication or by the wish to develop practical applications such as multimodal interfaces for human-machine interaction.",
        "Multimodal dialog systems will be a feature of many future applications, e.g., information systems.",
        "They will also be a feature of many VR systems and tutoring systems.",
        "The basic source of inspiration for dialog systems is ordinary human face-to-face communication involving both speech and gestures.",
        "However, our understanding of human communication as a multimodal phenomenon is still very insufficient.",
        "Thus, there is a need for tools which will enable us to gain a better understanding of the relations between properties of human face-to-face communication, such as gestures, intonation, words and grammar, and of how the utterances and gestures of different speakers are coordinated with each other.",
        "In this paper, we report on a long-term project to develop a platform for multimodal spoken language corpora.",
        "More specifically, we describe two modules of such a platform, which both exist in prototype implementations.",
        "The first of these modules, which is called TransTool, is a transcription editor which assists a human transcriber in producing transcriptions in accordance with a given standard and partially automates some of the tasks involved, e.g., in the marking of overlapping speech.",
        "The second one, SyncTool, is a tool for aligning transcriptions with the corresponding digitized audio and video recordings in order to allow synchronized display of different representations.",
        "Again, this is meant to provide support for a human analyst rather than to provide a completely automated process, although the latter would of course be preferable in the long run.",
        "Before we turn to a detailed description of TransTool and SyncTool, however, we will",
        "try to set the stage by presenting the platform for multimodal spoken language corpora of which these tools are meant to be part."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "Even though face-to-face spoken interaction is one of the most basic forms of human communication, many aspects of it are still not well understood.",
        "To some extent, this lack of knowledge is due to a lack of good data as well as adequate tools for presenting and analysing the data.",
        "In order to study spoken communication efficiently, we need not only recordings of naturally occurring spoken communication and transcriptions of these recordings, but also tools for presenting and analysing these transcriptions and recordings in a flexible and efficient manner.",
        "The picture is further complicated by the fact that face-to-face spoken communication is multimodal, involving gestures as well as speech, which means that video recordings are usually required.",
        "But this also means that transcriptions must be synchronized and displayed together not only with an acoustic signal but also in conjunction with visual data on gestures, etc., which tends to magnify the technical difficulties involved.",
        "Putting together a multimodal spoken language corpus is a very labor intensive task.",
        "First of all, manual transcription is laborious and time-consuming in itself, and even more so if the multimodal aspects of spoken communication are taken into consideration.",
        "To this we have to add the work needed to insure that transcriptions and recordings are properly aligned, so that they can be displayed and analysed in a synchronized fashion.",
        "In order to improve the situation, we need to develop adequate tools for the creation, maintenance and exploitation of multimodal spoken language corpora.",
        "Wherever possible, the aim should be to automate the processing, but for many of the tasks involved we will probably have to be content with providing computer support for manual work, support which either speeds up the process, or reduces the error rate, or indeed both.",
        "The Department of Linguistics at Goteborg University has been involved in the empirical study of face-to-face spoken communication since the late 1970s.",
        "This has resulted in a corpus of transcribed spoken Swedish, which contains a wide variety of different activity types and which currently contains about one million word tokens (cf. Allwood 1998).",
        "Over the years, a fairly detailed transcription standard has been developed, the most important features of which are the following (cf. Nivre 1998).",
        "• A transcription consists of a header, containing background information such as type of activity, participants, date of recording, duration, transcriber, etc., and a body, containing the transcription proper.",
        "• The transcription body consists of speech lines, containing the transcribed speech of dialog participants (each line introduced by a speaker initial); com-nzent lines, containing comments pertaining to phenomena in speech lines (see below); section lines, indicating boundaries between subactivities or topics; and time lines, containing information about the amount of time elapsed from the start of the activity.",
        "• Words are transcribed using standard orthography modified to capture spoken language variants and reductions (e.g., the Swedish first person pronoun 'jag' is transcribed `ja' or 'jag' according to the actual pronunciation).",
        "• Spoken language variants are indexed for disambiguation to the level of standard orthography (e.g., the Swedish first person pronoun is transcribed `ja 1 ' to distinguish it from the affirmative particle `ja0' [yes]).",
        "• Overlapping speech is marked by means of indexed square brackets (where the same index on different pairs of brackets indicate simultaneity).",
        "• Comments are made by enclosing the commented part of an utterance in (possibly indexed) angle brackets and putting the actual comment in matching brackets on a separate comment line.",
        "An elaborate system of standardized comments, including comments for the coding of gestures, allows automatic parsing of comment information.",
        "A short extract from a transcription, exemplifying most of the features discussed above, can be found in Figure 1.",
        "Producing transcriptions in accordance with this standard is a very time-consuming task without adequate tools.",
        "It can also be an error-prone task, mostly because it involves a lot of numerical indexing (of words, comments, overlaps, etc.).",
        "This is the reason that we have thought it necessary to develop a computer tool to assist the manual transcriber in this process and partially automate some of the tasks involved (cf. section 3).",
        "However, although transcriptions of this kind constitute a useful form of data for the study of spoken language, they are nevertheless insufficient in themselves and need to be supplemented with the actual sound and video recordings.",
        "Moreover, transcriptions and recordings need to be aligned so that analysts can view them together and do various types of coding and analysis based both on the recording and the transcription.",
        "In order to satisfy these needs, we believe that several tools are needed.",
        "Hence, we have embarked on the project of building a platform for multimodal spoken language corpora, consisting of a set of integrated tools for the creation, maintenance and use of such corpora.",
        "The planned tools of the platform are the following:",
        "• A tool for digitizing audiovisual corpus data (recordings).",
        "• A tool for producing and checking standardized transcriptions (TransTool).",
        "• A tool for semi-automatic alignment of audio/video and transcribed text (SyncTool).",
        "• A multimodal corpus presentation tool, allowing simultaneous and synchronized display of transcriptions and audio/video recordings.",
        "• A transcription coding tool, including display of transcriptions in different formats, with optional use of synchronized audio/video display.",
        "• An analysis tool for processing information from the coding tool (and from the corpus itself).",
        "If possible, all tools should be implemented in a platform-independent way and preferably allow access via the Internet.",
        "Before we go on to describe the two tools relating directly to transcription – TransTool and SyncTool – it might be worth addressing the question of why we have chosen to develop our own tools instead of using existing ones.",
        "The simple answer is that we have not so far been able to find any tools that provide the right kind of functionality in the right kind of environment.",
        "First of all, there is no abundance of software in this domain.",
        "Secondly, many of the programs that do exist are developed for a specific purpose or a specific standard, which makes them hard to use in other contexts.",
        "Finally, most of the programs are available only on one or two software platforms, which may or may not be a problem depending on whether this happens to coincide with the platforms that you are working with yourself.",
        "However, although we have not so far been able to reuse existing tools, it is clearly important to be open to developments within the area.",
        "In section 5, we will therefore make some brief comparisons between our tools and similar programs developed by others.",
        "Hopefully, this can contribute to a better understanding of the similarities and differences between different approaches and pave the way for cooperation in the future.",

        "The latest version of the program can be downloaded from http://www.ling.gu.se/gmslc/.",
        "TransTool is equipped with File-, Edit-and Format menus which operate in much the same way as in word processing programs (Figure 2).",
        "In addition, TransTool contains three special menus for the transcription of spoken language: the Add menu, the Comment menu, and the Tools menu.",
        "The Add menu (Figure 3) contains commands for starting a new utterance (New utterance), for inserting time codes (Time code) and section boundaries (Section), and for marking inaudible speech (Inaudible speech).",
        "All of these commands help speed up the transcription process while at the same time minimizing the risk for typing errors and ensuring conformance with the transcription standard.",
        "The Add menu also contains a command for marking overlapping speech (Overlap), which automatically inserts and keeps track of the numerical indices used to indicate which portions of speech overlap with each other (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "The final command in the Add menu is the command for adding a header to the transcription (Header).",
        "This command invokes a set of standardized forms, where the user has to fill in all the relevant information about the recorded activity, such as time and place of recording, type of activity, participants, transcriber, etc.",
        "involved in this particular conversation and appriopriate initials for them, transcriber, etc.",
        "The forms used to compose the header can be seen in Figures 4 and 5, while the resulting header can be seen in Figure 6.",
        "The second special menu is the Comments menu (Figure 7), where the user can select the whole range of standardized comments provided by the transcription standard.",
        "The comments are displayed in sub-menus, sorted",
        "by category, which may be ripped off and placed as separate windows on the screen.",
        "When using this menu, the user first selects the portion of speech that he wants to make a comment about, and then selects the appropriate type of comment from one of the sub-menus.",
        "The comments are automatically indexed.",
        "The final menu of interest is the Tools menu (Figure 8), which mainly contains commands for indexing.",
        "In addition to the indexing of comments and overlap (see above), which may need to be updated, the transcription also requires ambiguous spoken language variants (such as the pronunciation `ja' of the Swedish first person pronoun 'jag') to be disambiguated by numerical indices.",
        "This is done through the command MSO indices (where MSO stands for Modified Standard Orthography), which automatically identifies all word forms that need to be indexed and prompts the user for disambiguation."

        "• A transcription conforming to the transcription standard (cf. section 2).",
        "• A media file of some kind, containing the corresponding audio and/or video recording in digitized form.",
        "The user interface is quite straightforward.",
        "The user is presented with three windows (Figure 9):",
        "• The Transcript Score & Time Line Window presents the transcription in musical score format along with a time line extracted from the media and media control buttons (bottom window in Figure 9).",
        "• The Media Window (currently an external tool) displays the audio/video recording, allowing the user to swiftly move back and forth in the recording (top right window in Figure 9).",
        "• The Full Transcript Window displays the transcription in original format.",
        "All of these windows, except the Full Transcript Window are available in the prototype we have running.",
        "In the final version, while playing an audio or video sequence, the transcription will be scrolled and a visual cue will be shown to indicate which part of the transcription is currently on display.",
        "Media controls, such as Play, Stop, etc.",
        "will be available, as well as controls for setting the volume, playback speed, stepping back and forth in the recording and looping sequences.",
        "The Speaker Pane inside the Transcript Score & Time Line Window is where the transcription is presented to the user in the special score format used by SyncTool (Figure 10).",
        "The score format is a convenient way of displaying an ongoing dialog involving several speakers.",
        "Each speaker is assigned a 'channel' or track, and the utterances that s/he produces are segmented by means of transcription points.",
        "Transcription points correspond to speaker changes and the start and end of overlaps.",
        "The transcription points used to segement the utterances in the Speaker Pane are derived automatically from the underlying transcription.",
        "When a transcription is displayed in musical score format, transcription points span all the speaker channels in the Speaker Pane and are numbered, as can be seen in Figure 11.",
        "The Time Line Pane inside the Transcript Score & Timeline Window allows the user to specify where in the timeline of the recording each of the transcription points occur.",
        "Time is measured in minutes, seconds and frames for video with audio, and minutes, seconds and milliseconds for audio only recordings.",
        "A slider for each transcription point sets its time in the recording (as shown by the label beneath it), and can be moved back and forth through the timeline.",
        "Transcription point sliders cannot go outside their boundaries, e.g., it is not possible for transcription point 2 to move to the left of transcription point 1, or to the right of transcription point 3, and so on.",
        "In Figure 13 the correspondence between the transcription points in the Speaker Pane and in the Timeline Pane is highlighted with arrows.",
        "Initial placement of sliders is very roughly calculated with a simple algorithm, which distributes the sliders along the timeline more or less according to the length of the utterance.",
        "Note that we are not doing any kind of sound signal analysis; the algorithm is based on length of the text appearing in the transcript.",

        "Double clicking on a slider plays the recording from that transcription point.",
        "To stop playback, the user presses the space key on the keyboard.",
        "The prototype also implements primitive playback controls, currently only Start and Stop.",
        "These will be enhanced in upcoming versions.",
        "The Media Window is currently implemented as an external application, The Media Viewer.",
        "It has no user interface apart from the media controllers, and its only purpose is to allow other applications to communicate with it and programmatically tell it to open media files, start/stop playback, provide data on the movie, etc.",
        "It uses QuickTime and all the media formats that QuickTime supports (i.e. MPEG, QuickTime movies, AIFF, WAV, etc.",

        "The Media Viewer is available as a separate Macintosh application.",
        "Note however that we are in the process of implementing the functionality of The Media Viewer into SyncTool as plug-in module, which we hope will give us better control of how media files are used in SyncTool.",
        "Planned, but currently missing features include the possibility to visualize sound waves along the Time Line Pane, which will let users more easily position the transcription point sliders.",
        "We are also considering the inclusion of spectrograms, etc.",
        "Furthermore, we need to implement the real-time visual cue indicating which part of the transcription is being played back.",
        "This will be much easier to achieve when the Media Viewer functionality is built into SyncTool.",
        "Another feature that is going to be implemented is the possibility to add and delete transcription points, as well as separate tracks for different kinds of synchronisations (gestures, etc).",
        "In its current state, SyncTool is not only a synchronising tool, it is also a viewer of synchronized transcriptions.",
        "The tool presents audio, video and text simultaneously.",
        "The user can select parts of the transcription text and have the corresponding audio or video sequence played back with a minimum of effort.",
        "With this use in mind, the possibility to correct errors found in the transcription, such as incorrectly marked overlaps, will be a very useful feature too.",
        "The prototype has already shown its usefulness in this area, highlighting the usability of the score format.",
        "These errors are quite hard to discover using the traditional full view of a transcription.",
        "Therefore, it is possible that TransTool and SyncTool will be merged in the future.",

        "The Walk function plays the recording in manageable chunks so that the transcriber can concentrate on transcribing, as it automatically Walks through the recording one Step at a time.",
        "It plays a brief sound bite consisting of the first four seconds of the recording (one Step), and repeats this portion of sound several times to allow the user to transcribe it.",

        "It plays this new four-second chunk of sound several times, and then moves on to the third Step.",
