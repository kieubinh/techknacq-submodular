        "Large phonetic corpora including both standard and variant transcriptions are available for many languages.",
        "However, applications requiring the use of dynamic vocabularies make necessary to transcribe words not present in the dictionary.",
        "Also, additional alternative pronunciations to standard forms have shown to improve recognition accuracy.",
        "Therefore, new techniques to automatically generate variants in pronunciations have been investigated and proven to be very effective.",
        "However, rule-based systems still remain useful to generate standard transcriptions not previously available or to build new corpora, oriented chiefly to synthesis applications.",
        "The present paper describes a letter-to-phone conversion system for Spanish designed to supply transcriptions to the flexible vocabulary speech recogniser and to the synthesiser, both developed at CSELT (Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni), Turin, Italy.",
        "Different sets of rules are designed for the two applications.",
        "Symbols inventories also differ, although the IPA alphabet is the reference system for both.",
        "Rules have been written in ANSI C and implemented on DOS and Windows 95 and can be selectively applied.",
        "Two speech corpora have been transcribed by means of these grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules: a) the SpeechDat Spanish corpus which includes 4444 words extracted from the phonetically balanced sentences of the database b) a corpus designed to train an automatic aligner to segment units for synthesis, composed of 303 sentences (3240 words) and 338 isolated words; rule-based transcriptions of this corpus were manually corrected.",
        "The phonetic forms obtained by the rules matched satisfactorily the reference transcriptions: most mistakes on the first corpus were caused by the presence of secondary stresses in the SpeechDat transcriptions, which were not assigned by the rules, whereas errors on the synthesis corpus appeared mostly on hiatuses and on words of foreign origin.",
        "Further developments oriented to recognition can imply addition of rules to account for Latin American pronunciations (especially Mexican, Argentinian and Paraguayan); for synthesis, on the other hand, rules to represent coarticulatory phenomena at word boundaries can be implemented, in order to transcribe whole sentences."

      "text": [
        "Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is an important prerequisite for many applications involving speech synthesis and recognition [1].",
        "Large corpora used for these applications (e.g. WSJ, CMU, Oxford Pronunciation Dictionary, ONOMASTICA, SpeechDat) include phonetic transcriptions for both standard pronunciations and for variants, which can represent either differences in dialectal or individual realisation of single words (intra-word variants) [2, 3] or variations in the standard form produced by coarticulation between words (inter-word variants) [4].",
        "These alternative pronuciations have been shown to improve recognition accuracy [5] and they need to be present in lame phonetic database: the variants can either be realised manually on the basis of expert phonetic knowledge, or by a rule-based system.",
        "However, maintenace of such systems is complex, because insertion of new rules often causes to change the overall performance of the module.",
        "Therefore, new techniques to derive automatically rules for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion from training data have been investigated.",
        "Generally rules are obtained through forced recognition, according to the following procedure: 1) aligning of the canonical pronunciation to the alternative ones by means of a dynamic programming algorithm, in order to generate an aligned database 2) use this database to train a statistical model or a binary decision tree to generate variants of words or proper names [1] [3] [6] [5] or to model context-dependent variations at word boundary [4]; neural networks can also be used to generate variants in pronunciation of words [2] or of surnames [7], on the basis of pre-aligned or non-aligned training data [8].",
        "Finally, a mixed approach combining knowledge obtained from training data and a priori phonetic expertise has also been experimented to derive possible non-native pronunciations of English and Italian words [9].",
        "All these techniques have proven to be very effective to generate plausible alternatives to canonical ones.",
        "However, rule-based approaches can still represent an effective tool to automatically obtain standard transcriptions of large corpora built ad hoc for special applications, in particular oriented to synthesis: a letter-to-phone rules component is very suitable to represent allophonic and allomorphic variations [10] [11] [12] which are essential to allow segmentation and diphone extraction from an acoustic database [13].",
        "The rule system described in the present paper was developed on the basis of phonetic knowledge [14] [15] and has two different application domains, which imply different transcription requirements: the recog.niser for Spanish uses sub-word units [16] [17] linked to the phonetic representation of isolated words; the units have been trained on the corpus of words extracted from the phonetically balanced sentences included in the SpeechDat database.",
        "Therefore, the SpeechDat corpus has been considered as the reference set of words that the conversion rules minimally had to correctly transcribe.",
        "Only isolated words were used, with the same phoneme inventory employed in the original SpeechDat transcriptions, including no allophones.",
        "On the other hand, the corpus for synthesis was selected to collect speech material to train the automatic phonetic aligner, in order to extract diphones for a concatenative synthesis system [18] and had to meet different requirements: a) units were to be pronounced both in isolated words and in sentences b) the phoneme inventory had to include the maximum number of allophones so to allow to build a representative acoustic dictionary containing occurences of all units and sequences in every appropriate segmental and prosodic context (stressed and unstressed syllables; initial and final position in the syllable; initial, internal and final position in the sentence; short and long sentences).",
        "Therefore, two partially different sets of rules have been designed for synthesis and recognition, which can be alternatively activated: the latter are a subset of the former.",
        "Both systems provide only",
        "one variant in output, i.e. the standard Castilian (Madrid) Spanish pronunciation.",
        "1.",
        "Orthographic and phonetic symbols",
        "The orthographic string in input is preprocessed to avoid problems relative to the configuration of the operating system: at this stage, letters with diacritics (corresponding to non-standard ASCII characters) can either be represented by means of extended ASCII (e.g. '11.",
        "= ext.",
        "ASCII code 241) or they can be converted into a sequence of standard ASCII symbols ('n â€“ ' = st. ASCII 110+126).",
        "This preprocessing is common to both the recognition and the synthesis systems.",
        "The phonetic symbols used for recognition represent the 30 basic Spanish phones, which are also common to synthesis.",
        "For this latter system, however, 11 extra symbols have also been added to represent a set of allophones of the standard Spanish which show an acoustic structure clearly differentiated from the rest of already included allophones.",
        "These symbols represent stressed vowels, semivowels (i.e. [i] and [u] allophones in second position of falling diphthongs, distinguished from semi-consonants, or glides, i. e. [i] and [u] allophones in first position of rising diphthongs), the nasal labiodental allophone [n]], the palatal voiced stop [J], which accounts for the distribution of the palatal voiced approximant [j], in initial position or after '1' or 'n'(e.g. 'cOnyuge' = [k 'o Gn J u x e]) and the interdental voiced fricative [0], which accounts for the distribution of the the unvoiced interdental fricative [Q], in end of syllable before a voiced consonant (e.g. 'llovizna [L o .",
        "B'i Zh .",
        "n a]).",
        "Finally, two phones typical of most frequent foreign loan words, i.e. the unvoiced dental affricate [ts] (e.g. 'pizza') and the unvoiced palatal fricative [5] (e.g. 'flash') were added.",
        "This gives a final set of 43 synthesis symbols."
