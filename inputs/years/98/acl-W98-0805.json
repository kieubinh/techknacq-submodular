        "There are a range of choices to be made when deciding on the contents of spoken language corpora.",
        "Useful information will be made available by including prosodic annotations but this is difficult to automate.",
        "This paper looks at the advantages that can be expected to accrue from the inclusion of minimal prosodic information, major and minor tone unit boundaries, or pauses.",
        "Capturing this information automatically does not present the same difficulties as producing a full prosodic annotation: a method is described by (Huckvale and Fang, 1996).",
        "A purpose of this paper is to show that the development of such methods warrants further investigation.",
        "The task which prompted this investigation will use trained speakers in a controlled environment, as described below.",
        "We investigate how much extra information is captured by representing major and minor pauses, as well as words, in a corpus of spoken English.",
        "We find that for speech such as broadcast news or talks the inclusion of this minimal prosodic annotation will lower the perplexity of a language model.",
        "This result is of general interest, and supports the development of improved language models for many applications.",
        "However, the specific issue which we address is a task in broadcasting technology: the semi-automated production of online subtitles for live television programmes.",
        "Contemporaneous subtitling of television programmes for the hearing impaired is set to increase significantly, and in the UK there is a mandatory requirement placed on TN broadcasters to cover a certain proportion of live programmes.",
        "This skilled task is currently done by highly trained stenographers (the subtitlers), but it could be semi-automated.",
        "First, the subtitlers can transfer broadcast speech to written captions using automated speech recognition systems instead of specialist keyboards.",
        "A similar approach is being introduced for some Court reporting, where trained speakers in a controlled environment may replace traditional stenographers.",
        "Secondly, the display of the captions can be automated, which is the problem we address here.",
        "It is necessary to place line breaks in appropriate places so the subtitler can be relieved of this secondary task.",
        "Based on previous work in this field (Lyon and Frank, 1997) a system will be developed to process the output of an ASR device.",
        "We need to collect examples of this output as corpora of training data, and have investigated the type",
        "of information that it will be useful to obtain.",
        "Commercially available speech recognizers typically output only the words spoken by the user, but as an intermediate stage in producing subtitles we may want to use prosodic information that has been made explicitly available.",
        "Information theoretic techniques can be used to determine how useful it is to capture minimal prosodic information, major and minor pauses.",
        "The experiments reported here take a prosodi-cally marked corpus of spoken English, the Machine Readable Spoken English Corpus (MARSEC).",
        "Different representations are compared, in which the language model either omits or includes major and minor pauses as well as words.",
        "We need to assess how much the structure of language is captured by the different methods of representation, and an objective method of evaluation is provided by entropy indicators, described below.",
        "The relationship between prosody and syntax is well known (Arnfield, 1994; Fang and Huckvale, 1996: Ostendorf and Vielleux, 1994; Taylor and Black, 1998).",
        "Work in this field has typically focussed on the problem in speech synthesis of mapping a text onto natural sounding speech.",
        "Our work investigates the complementary problem of mapping speech onto segmented text.",
        "It is not claimed that pauses are only produced as structural markers: hesitation phenomena perform a number of roles, particularly in spontaneous speech.",
        "However, it has been shown that the placement of pauses provide clues to syntactic structure.",
        "We introduce a statistical measure that can help indicate whether it is worth going to the trouble of capturing certain types of prosodic information for processing the output of trained speakers."
