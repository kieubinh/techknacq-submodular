        "Name recognition has emerged as an NLP technology that is effective and can provide high value to several different kinds of applications, such as clustering and summarization (Aone and Maloney, 1997; Aone et al., 1997).",
        "Development of such a capability for Arabic involved meeting some new challenges.",
        "Like other Semitic writing systems, Arabic does not exhibit differences in orthographic case.",
        "Un",
        "like in English-language mixed-case texts, therefore, there is no obvious clue such as initial capitalized letters to indicate the presence of a name constituent.",
        "In our experience with Thai and other non-case writing systems, this seems to effectively impose a requirement that there be some understanding of the morphological nature of each token – especially part-of-speech information.",
        "Having some morphological information allows one to make distinctions between likely and unlikely name constituents, which is particularly important when deciding where a name ends and the non-name context begins.",
        "We partially motivate this for Arabic as follows:3",
        "• Closed-class items are rarely, if ever, part of an Arabic proper name: [Hasan fi], with a preposition in second position, seems an unlikely Arabic name.4 • Inflected forms of verbs are rarely part of proper names: [yata9allamu], \"he learns,\" is not a permissible name constituent.5 • Many lexical items, of course, are not used, or highly unlikely to be used, in proper names: verbs of speaking or cognition, for example, do not appear to occur in names and they do not frequently overlap in appearance with proper name constituents: [muHammad qultu] is an unlikely name.",
        "• Items with subject or object suffixes are rarely, if ever, part of names: [yukaatibuhu], \"He will correspond with him.\"",
        "In addition, there are many positive cues, such as titles, frequent given names, and so forth, that allow a system to identify names, but some morphological characterization of non-name portions is of critical importance.",
        "We will discuss this in more detail below in Section 4."

        "Text encoded in ISO-8859-6 is first passed through this tokenizer and then the tokenized stream is processed by the Name Finder module which identifies names and other extraction targets and annotates the text with appropriate SGML tags for each extracted item."

      "heading": "2.1 Morphological Tokenizer 2.1.1 Description",
      "text": [
        "The Morphological Tokenizer's basic task is to identify the sequences of words, punctuation symbols, numbers, existing SGML tags, etc., that comprise the input text.",
        "For each such \"token,\" a description of what it has found is returned as a vector of up to 32 application-definable bits (e.g., PUNCTUATION, WORD, NUMBER).",
        "The Tokenizer is a very fast program, generated using the Flex scanner-generator from a tokenizer specification.",
        "We decided to augment the tokenizer's usual role.",
        "While it still finds numbers and punctuation tokens, it treats an Arabic word (a contiguous sequence of Arabic letters) as a collection of one or more morpheme tokens, each with its own bit-vector of properties.",
        "The properties include those listed above, as well as morphology-specific properties whose nature and linguistic motivation is discussed in the next section.",
        "Making the morphological analysis part of tokenization has the advantage of maintaining the high speed of SRA's TurboTag.",
        "An external morphology module – with a high computation overhead – would degrade performance.",
        "Table 1 contains the features identified by the tokenizer.",
        "Each token in the text receives some subset of the lexical types in Table 1.",
        "For example, a string such as arbh, phonetically [§aribahu], \"he drank it,\" receives the tokenizer types ARABIC, PERFECT, and SUFFIX.",
        "The first type means that the token comprises Arabic letters, the second that it is a Perfect verb form, and the third that there is a suffix attached.",
        "Note that in this case, the string is not broken up into pieces, such as stem and suffix.",
        "It re",
        "mains a single token with information being added as to what the component pieces are.",
        "The only cases where the tokenizer splits off pieces of a string are where there is an attached conjunction (we or fa) or an attached preposition (la, ba, ka), or both.",
        "In these cases, in place of an original string such as orthographic wel, phonetic [waq5.1a], \"and he said,\" there will be two separate tokens: [wa] with the type information ARABIC and CONJ, and [gala] with the type information ARABIC and PERFECT.",
        "Some of these tokenizer types are exclusive, such as PERFECT and IMPERFECT.",
        "A token cannot be both simultaneously.",

      "heading": "2.1.2 Implementation",
      "text": [
        "We initially developed the morphological analysis module as a sequence of 31 patterns in Perl's regular expression language.",
        "This allowed us to efficiently",
        "develop and refine the patterns needed to recognize the various morphological word-shapes.",
        "When we plugged this version of the morphological analyzer into the original tokenizer, however, processing was quite slow due to the sequential nature of our morphological patterns and the backtracking nature of Perl's regular expression matcher.",
        "To compensate, we incorporated the morphological functionality directly into the Flex specification of the tokenizer.",
        "Whenever the Flex-generated scanner identifies an Arabic word, it dispatches the appropriate regular-expression to extract the separate morphemes from that word – a task that is beyond the capability of Flex.",
        "The result is the fastest Arabic morphological analyzer we are aware of: The overall processing rate for TAGARAB is approximately 46 megabytes/hour on a Sun Ultra 1.",
        "Morphological processing by itself runs at about 190 megabytes/hour.",
        "We had originally planned to develop a morphological capability that would be helpful in improving name recognition, as discussed in Section 1.2.",
        "In the following, we discuss the linguistic design of the morphological analysis.",
        "Arabic is a highly inflected language.",
        "We believed that there are frequently enough surface cues in the shape of an Arabic word' to allow the assignment of the kind of morphological information described in Section 2.1.1.",
        "For example, inflected forms of derived verb stems such as [yaftatiHu], \"he inaugurates,\" would seem to have an orthographic \"shape\" that is fairly unique in an Arabic text.",
        "We felt that this information could be exploited to successfully identify tokens as nouns, verbs (perfects or 7TAGARAB deals exclusively with the written form, i.e., without indication of short vowels.",
        "imperfects), etc., to a sufficiently reliable extent that the later name-recognition patterns could effectively make use of it.",
        "The morphological analysis process consists of a series of regular expressions partially supported by lists of noun, verb, and adjective stems, as well as closed-class items.",
        "The regular expressions cover all allowable prefixes and suffixes for each stem type.",
        "Infixation phenomena, however, such as the infixed I of the Eighth Verbal Form,8 are handled as variant forms in the verb stem list e.g., '9tbr, \"he consid-ered\" and 9br, \"he crossed.\" No attempt is made to handle co-occurrence constraints among prefixes and suffixes, nor to assign voice.",
        "Likewise, no attempt is made to include contextual information, as is done with standard part-of-speech taggers.",
        "There is no attempt to handle ambiguity: The regular expression patterns are ordered, and the search for an analysis of a word stops at the first match.",
        "The token types are then assigned, and the form is not submitted to any other regular expressions.",
        "Not all Arabic tokens are hit by one of these regular-expression patterns that provide morphological features.",
        "Although there is a mix of patterns supported by lexical information and patterns that operate entirely by rule (no supporting lexical data), the vast majority of matches appear to occur with the former set of patterns.",
        "In other words, the coverage of the morphological analysis is crucially dependent on the lexical data.",
        "There are 1051 noun forms, 813 verb forms, and 241 adjective forms.",
        "There is also a comprehensive list of closed-class items.",
        "The notion of \"lexical item\" in TAGARAB's lists is somewhat similar to the listing principle found in Landau : broken plural forms for nouns and ad",
        "jectives receive an independent entry, much like different stems of verbs as mentioned previously.",
        "We make no effort to distinguish I and II forms of verbs, as these are not usually distinguished orthographically in Al-Hayat.",
        "In general, if there is no visible orthographic distinction in normal Arabic prose, we do not make a distinction in the lexical data.",
        "We also entered forms both with and without hamza, as in Al-Ha yat any form that may receive a hamza may also appear without it (even in the same text!).",
        "Another important feature is that we entered only what seemed to us to be frequent lexical items in the lexical lists, and tried to do it in such a manner that what seemed intuitively the most likely reading of a form would be the one selected.",
        "This makes sense in the case of such a highly deterministic morphology and also given our time and resource constraints.",
        "We wanted to ensure that we got the right readings for a large number of highly frequent items, as this would be the most useful way to constrain the name-recognition patterns.",
        "Many high-frequency common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech in Arabic do not usually form part of names.",
        "As it turned out (See Section 4 below), this strategy worked quite well with person names but was less significant for organization names.",
        "We also decided not to enter items that are used directly by the later name-recognition patterns, such as locations and given names, as these are accessed by the patterns through that module's own word lists and therefore having a morphological reading for them is not important (see Section 2.2).",
        "In addition to the supporting lexical data, the ordering of the regular expressions also aided in determining the analysis selected.",
        "The regular expressions are grouped functionally, and in general the ones pertaining to closed class items apply first, then nouns, adjectives, perfects, and imperfects in that order.",
        "This had the effect that items which are highly \"marked\" as belonging to one category (e.g., verbs with a double pronominal object) would be captured appropriately by a verb-recognizing regular expression that looks for such suffixes, but that items that are not so highly marked (e.g., a simple third-person masculine perfect form) would be biased towards a reading according to the order of the regular expressions.",
        "We were pleasantly surprised to learn that this kind of approach – although obviously simplistic in some ways – produces a very high level of precision in analysis (i.e., the parts of speech assigned tend strongly to be correct) and surprisingly good recall (i.e., there is good coverage of the corpus).",
        "We discuss our empirical results in Section 3.",
        "In addition, the morphological information thus produced contributed substantially to the effectiveness of the name-recognition patterns.",

        "In addition, we have shown that named entity recognition in Arabic can be performed at levels consistent with other non-case languages despite great differences in structure between them.",
        "Finally, we have shown that morphological information is crucially important to effective Arabic name recognition."
