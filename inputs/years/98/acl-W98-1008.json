        "Thus, in the case of Arabic, both the melody and the pattern of consonants are defined independently of a root in helping paradigms, while in Calder's approach, one has to be arbitrarily chosen as basic (as belonging to the root), and regularities about that morpheme are lost."

        "But even though two-level systems are successful in practice, they suffer from a number of shortcomings: they are not really morphological systems, but phonological systems, as they focus on the phonology (or orthography) of words, and not on the morphology; morphotactics is usually implemented using continuation lexicons12 (which implies that bound morphemes are lexical entries like stems, a disputable assumption); it assumes a linear view of phonology, which has been shown since the late seventies to be inadequate for the description of natural language phonology (Goldsmith 1990).",
        "Also, since this approach to morphology is particularly suited to concatenative morphology, new systems have to be built in order to account for non-concatenative languages (with the exception, maybe, of Beesley's system which can reuse the runtime code used for other languages; but compilation necessitates new code specific to Arabic).",
        "I will not try to argue that the framework I advocate will produce better results in terms of speed and efficiency: the advantages of finite state techniques in that respect have been shown countless times.",
        "But there are other aspects to consider, besides efficiency: type of linguistic analysis allowed by the framework; whether different types of morphological processes can be accounted for; interface with other components of an NLP system (such as a syntactic parser), since morphological analysis is usually not an end in itself.",
