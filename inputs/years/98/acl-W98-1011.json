        "While the morphology of Modern Hebrew is well accounted for computationally, there are few computational grammars describing the syntax of the language.",
        "Existing grammars are scarcely based on solid linguistic grounds: they do not conform to any particular linguistic theory and do not provide a linguistically plausible analysis for the data they cover.",
        "This paper presents a first attempt towards the construction of a formal grammar for a fragment of Hebrew that is both linguistically motivated and computationally implementable.",
        "The grammar, concentrating on the structure of noun phrases, is designed in accordance with HPSG, a linguistic theory that lends itself most naturally to computational implementation.",
        "It is the first application of HPSG to any Semitic language.",
        "Several theoretical issues are addressed, including the status of the definite article, the application of the DP hypothesis to Hebrew, definiteness agreement in the noun phrase as well as definiteness inheritance in constructs.",
        "All the analyses presented in the paper were tested and their predictions were verified.",

        "Modem Hebrew (MH) poses some interesting problems for the grammar designer.",
        "The Hebrew script is highly ambiguous, a fact that results in many part-of-speech tags for almost every word (Oman, 1994).",
        "Short prepositions, articles and conjunctions are usually attached to the words that immediately succeed them.",
        "In addition, Hebrew morphology is very rich: a noun base might have over fifteen different derivations, and a verb – over thirty.",
        "In spite of the difficulties, disambiguation of the script, as well as morphological analysis, were covered by a variety of works (Bentur et al., 1992; Choueka and Ne'eman, 1995; Oman and Katz, 1995).",
        "From a practical point of view, Hebrew morphology is well accounted for.",
        "The syntax of the language, however, remains an open problem.",
        "The first syntactic analyzer for Hebrew is described in (Cohen, 1984), but its grammar is implicit in a software system.",
        "Niren-burg and Ben-Asher (1984) describe a small-scale ATN for Hebrew, capable of recognizing very limited structures.",
        "Unification-based formalisms were used for developing Hebrew grammars only recently.",
        "A limited experiment using PATR-II is described in (Wintner, 1992); it is extended (\\Vintner and Oman, 1996) to a reasonable subset of the language, on a different platform: Tomita's LR Parser/Compiler, which is based on LFG.",
        "The grammar recognizes sentences of wide variety and complexity, but the analyses it provides are not conveyed in the framework of any particular linguistic theory.",
        "A different work along the same lines is (Yizhar, 1993): using the same framework, it concentrates on the syntax of noun phrases, employing ideas from different linguistic theories.",
        "Works related to the syntax of Hebrew, and in particular to noun phrases, are abundant in the theoretical linguistics literature (Borer, 1984; Ritter, 1991; Siloni, 1994).",
        "All of them are carried out in Chomskian frameworks; none can be directly implemented computationally, and their predictions cannot be verified on the basis of existing on-line corpora.",
        "The practical contribution of these works is thus limited.",
        "This paper describes the first stages of an attempt to bridge the gap between linguistically theoretic analyses and computational implementations.",
        "Using HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994) as the linguistic theory in which analyses are conveyed, grammars can be directly implemented and their predictions verified.",
        "HPSG is used for formally describing the structure of a variety of languages, but this is the first time the theory is applied to any Semitic language.",
        "While some ideas of existing",
        "Hebrew grammars, in particular (Wintner and Or-nan, 1996) and (Yizhar, 1993), are incorporated into the work described here, the starting point is new: we present an account of several aspects of the Hebrew noun phrase, aligned with the general principles of HPSG.",
        "All the analyses described in the paper were computationally implemented using AMALIA (Wmtner, 1997a) as the development framework.",
        "The phenomena we address include the status of the definite article, the application of the DP hypothesis to Hebrew, definiteness agreement in noun phrases as well as definiteness inheritance in constructs.",
        "This is a work in progress, and the results described here are preliminary.",
        "The grammar is not intended to have a broad coverage, but rather to provide explanatory structures to linguistically interesting phenomena.",
        "However, we hope to extend the coverage of the grammar in the future, maintaining its linguistic rigor."

        "HPSG is formulated as a set of constraints on typed feature structures (TFSs) that are used to model linguistic information in all levels: from the lexicon, through grammatical principles, to complete analyses.",
        "HPSG \"rules\" are organized as principles that set constraints on the properties of well-formed phrases, along with ID schemata that license certain phrase structures.",
        "The schemata are independent of the categories of the involved phrases; they state general conditions for the construction of larger phrases out of smaller ones, according to the function of the sub-phrases (e.g., subject-head, head-complement, specifier-head etc.)",
        "ID schemata only license certain phrase combinations.",
        "They do not specify all the constraints imposed on the involved sub-phrases, as these are articulated by the principles.",
        "Like other current linguistic theories, HPSG is highly lexical: most of the information is encoded in highly articulated lexical entries associated with words.",
        "The constraints on the grammar are usually few and very general.",
        "An elaborate set of lexical rules relates lexical entries, either to account for morphology or to introduce changes in the TFSs associated with the basic entries."

        "In FG the definiteness of the possessor is independent of that of the head, allowing for four different combinations of definiteness (both the head and the possessor can each be either definite or indefinite) (2); in CS, the definiteness of the phrase is inherited from the possessor, allowing only two combinations: either both are definite, or both are not (3).",

        "Following Abney (1987), analyses carried out in Chomskian frameworks view noun phrases as DPs, headed by the functional category D. The DP hypothesis (DPH) has been applied to a variety of languages and is incorporated into most existing accounts for Modern Hebrew.",
        "Originally motivated",
        "by the English `-ing' gerunds, that possess simultaneously properties of both sentences and noun phrases, the importance of the DPH is that it assigns parallel structures to clauses and noun phrases; in particular, both are headed by functional categories.",
        "In HPSG, however, functional categories are discouraged: English noun phrases are viewed as NPs, headed by the noun, and determiners – as subcate-gorized specifiers of nouns (Pollard and Sag, 1994, section 9.4).",
        "HPSG analyses for other languages, notably German, consider article-noun combinations to be DPs (Netter, 1994).",
        "Preferring either of the two analyses, in the context of HPSG, boils down to deciding whether it is the determiner or the noun that heads a nominal phrase.",
        "Applying the criteria of (Zwicky, 1985) we show that in Hebrew it is the noun that heads the noun phrases.",
        "Netter (1994) lists several considerations in favor of each of the alternatives.",
        "In German, all the morphosyntactic features that must be transferred to the maximal projection of a nominal phrase (for agreement or government purposes) are manifested equally well both on the article and on the noun.",
        "Detenninerless noun phrases require, in German, disjunctive subcatego-rization frames for nouns under an NP analyses, and empty categories in a DP analysis.",
        "Finally, it is the declension phenomenon that causes Netter (1994) to favor a DP analysis.",
        "When applied to MH, these considerations yield a different result: information that is relevant for agreement, such as number and gender, is expressed on the noun only; determiner-less phrases are always grammatical; and there are no declensions.",
        "Nevertheless, most existing analyses of MH noun phrases apply the DPH, with the definite article as the D head (Ritter, 1988; Ritter, 1991; Siloni, 1991; Siloni, 1994).",
        "For lack of space we cannot survey the motivation for such analyses here; the argumentation relies on derived (deverbal) nouns, especially in CS noun phrases, including the following observations: the inability of cs-nouns to be rendered definite directly (i.e., the fact that ha never attaches to them); the impossibility of direct modification of such nouns (i.e., the fact the any adjectives must follow the genitive complement in CS); and the inheritance of definiteness from the complement in CS.",
        "These, along with theory-internal considerations, yield an analysis by which noun phrases are DPs, headed by the functional, possibly phonologically null, category D, and necessitating a compulsory movement of the head noun.",
        "FG noun phrases require yet another functional (and empty) category.",
        "We show in (Wintner, 1998) that there is no theory-independent reason to apply the DPH to Hebrew; on the contrary, such accounts miss generalizations and yield wrong predictions.",
        "We show below that an NP analysis is not only possible but also plausible, accounting for a body of data, traditionally believed to require functional categories and compulsory head raising in noun phrases.",
        "Many of the limitations of the analyses mentioned above are listed by Borer (1994), suggesting that definiteness is a feature of nouns, base generated on the N stem.",
        "An affixal view of the MH definite article is established in (Wintner, 1997b), and is the starting point for the analysis we propose here.",
        "We first account for the fact that cs-nouns must have an immediate complement.",
        "We then explain why the article does not combine with cs-nominals.",

        "The value of this feature can either be an empty list, or a list of one element, in which case the element must be reentrant with some element in some valence list of the word (in other words, DEP points to some element on the ARG_S value of the word).",
