        "A recent survey, based on the most well known Maltese dictionary [1], found that the origin of the words is 40% Semitic, 40% Romance (Italian) and 20% English.",
        "The linguistic processing has therefore to take into account this mixed structure.",
        "The purpose of this work was to analyse the words to try and distinguish function words and verb words in the running text, within a text-to-speech synthesis application.",
        "This is necessary to obtain pause information at appropriate word boundaries.",
        "Therefore only a partial lexical analysis is being considered.",
        "The method used here involves a rule based system with separation between the rule definitions, the rule operations and the input data formalism.",
        "Two databases have the function words and the verb words respectively, to compare with the word under test.",
        "The rule formalisms are kept in small local tables pertaining to the various rules under test.",
        "In this way addition/deletion of the data is completely independent of the rule formalism, and rules can be added or amended independently of each other."

        "As in other Semitic languages, Maltese words of semitic origin do not have a stem to which affixes are connected, but rather use transfixes.",
        "The stem or root is made up of a number of consonants, which can never occur in isolation, and whose order cannot be altered.",
        "Transfixes are then added to the root, sometimes also with prefixes and suffixes.",
        "Transfixes are made up of a number of vowels and may include operation on consonants such as doubling the middle consonant, (geminate).",
        "On the other hand, words of Romance origin follow the usual pattern of a stem and affixes of the inflectional and derivational type to form other lexemes.",
        "For example the semitic derivations from k,t,b are kiteb to write kitba writing ktib writings ktieb book ktejjeb small book kittieb writer mikteb writing desk nkiteb to be written while romance derivations from"

        "Errors were considered to be of two types.",
        "These are no classification errors when either a function or a verb word was not classified, and misclassification when a verb word was classified as an adjective or noun, and viceversa.",
        "The results gave errors of the first type whenever the corresponding stem was not in the database.",
        "Errors of type 2 occurred in the case of one verb category, otherwise all function and verb words were classified correctly.",
        "The error occurs because in the verb category CVCV the derivational morphology between verb and noun or adjective involves only a change of vowels.",
        "For example bedg, (he started); bidu (start).",
        "The analysis therefore yields both types as being possible valid answers for the word, though clearly a native speaker can distinguish between them.",
        "One of the future features to be added is to use a vowel tier on the present morphological analysis structure.",
        "CONCLUSIONS A rule based analysis suitable for a language with a mixed linguistic categories was designed.",
        "This was based on a separation of database and rule definitions enabling a quicker analysis as well as easier addition / deletion of rules based on a set of rule formalisms."
