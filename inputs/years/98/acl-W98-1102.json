        "Today, corpora are considered to be indispensable to NLP work: they provide information for the creation of other resources (e.g., lexicons), enable the gathering of statistics on real-language use to inform theories and algorithms, and provide the raw materials for testing and training.",
        "Their importance is widely acknowledged: the creation of the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) in the United States and the European Language Resources Association (ELRA) in Europe shows the commitment of funding agencies on both sides of the Atlantic to gathering and distributing corpora for research use.",
        "In addition to creating large-scale corpora, it is also necessary to develop standards for their encoding, in order to ensure their usability and, most importantly, reusability in corpus-based NLP work.",
        "Many freely available tools for language-related tasks such as segmentation, part of speech tagging, etc., exist, and even more in-house tools exist in labs and research centers.",
        "Input and output formats for these tools are rarely, if ever, compatible with each other, nor with the encoding formats in available corpora.",
        "Translation among formats is not a matter of simple transduction: sometimes the information needed by a tool does not exist in the data; sometimes it is not unambiguously translatable; sometimes the tool cannot retain information present in the original data and it is lost in processing.",
        "As a result, enormous amounts of research time and effort are currently spent massaging data and tools for compatibility.",
        "This in itself motivates establishing common encoding formats, to avoid redundant effort.",
        "This need has been acknowledged in Europe for several years, through efforts such as EAGLES.",
        "Recently, recognizing the amount of time and effort involved in creating and annotating corpora, this need has gained the attention of North American researchers and funders as well (see, in particular, the conclusions of an NSF-sponsored international workshop on the future directions of NLP research [Hovy and Ide, 1998]).",
        "Designing a coherent encoding scheme is by no means trivial.",
        "It demands, first, the development of a sound model of the data to be represented and all its relevant features and attributes, as well as their structural, logical, linguistic, etc.",
        "relationships; together with consideration of processing needs).",
        "The format should provide for incremental encoding, allowing for enhancement of data with various kinds of annotation.",
        "Very few encoding formats have been designed with such considerations in view, resulting in the proliferation of a variety of encoding schemes (even within a common SGML/XML framework) which are, all too often, poorly designed and ultimately unsuitable for extensive use.",
        "This paper describes the motivation and design of the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) Ode,",
        "et al., (1996); Ide, 1998), an encoding standard for linguistic corpora intended to meet the need for the principled development of standardized encoding practices for linguistic corpora.",
        "The CES was initiated within the European projects EAGLES (in particular, the EAGLES Text Representation subgroup) and Multext (EU-LRE), together with the Vassar/CNRS collaboration (supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation).",
        "The CES has so far been used in several pan-European corpus encoding projects, including PAROLE' and TELRI2, as well as numerous smaller projects in both Europe and North America, and it has recently been adopted as a basis for the TIPSTER document attributes and annotations."

        "The CES is an application of SGML4 (ISO 8879:1986, Information Processing--Text and Office Systems--Standard Generalized Markup Language), conformant to the TEI Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 1994).",
        "The CES is designed for encoding corpora used as a resource across a broad range of language processing applications, including machine translation, information retrieval and extraction, lexicography, etc.",
        "Corpora are used primarily in these applications to gather real language evidence, both qualitative and quantitative; therefore the CES is designed to enable the common operations such as extraction of sub-corpora; sophisticated search and retrieval (e.g., collocation extraction, concordance generation, generation of lists of linguistic elements, etc.",
        "); and the generation of statistics (frequency information, averages, mutual information scores, etc.).",
        "The design of the CES is motivated by three overall goals:",
        "• to provide encoding specifications that include elements relevant to language processing work and reflect best practice in the field, and that are both flexible enough to accommodate the range of current use and precise enough to provide clear guidelines for encoders and annotators; • to minimize the costs of corpus creation, annotation, and use;",
        "• to provide specifications that ensure the maximum of usability and reusability with corpus-processing software and in integrated platforms.",
        "Each of these goals is discussed more fully below.",

        "The CES uses the TEI scheme as a starting point.",
        "However, the TEI Guidelines are designed to be applicable across a broad range of applications and disciplines and therefore treat a vast array of textual phenomena beyond what is needed for a particular application.",
        "Therefore, the CES limits the TEI scheme to include only the subset of the TEI tagset relevant for corpus-based work.",
        "The CES also makes choices among TEI encoding options, constraining or simplifying the TEI specifications as appropriate; for example:",
        "• element content models are substantially simplified, in order to maximize the ability to validates encoded documents; • attributes and attribute values are constrained or extended to serve the needs of corpus-based applications; • the TEI element and attribute class strategy • is adopted, but the classes are simplified to form a shallow hierarchy with no overlaps; • the TEI Guidelines are extended to meet the specific needs of corpus-based work; in particular: - addition of elements and DTD fragments for areas not covered by the TEI (e.g., detailed encoding of morpho-syntactic annotation)",
        "- specification of precise values for some attributes specification of required, recommended, and optional elements to be marked detailed semantics for elements relevant to language engineering (e.g., sentence, word, etc.)",
        "s Validation is the process by which software checks that the formal specifications of a Document Type Definition (DID), which is a BNF description of legal tag syntaxare adhered to in a document's markup (e.g., tags are properly nested, appear in the correct order, contain all required tags; attributes appear when and only when they should, have valid values; etc.",
        ").",
        "Beyond this common basis, the CES diverges from the TEI in two major ways: first, in its data architecture and supporting set of DTDs (as opposed to the single, encompassing TEI DTD); and second, in its overall design philosophy.",
        "The TEI began development over ten years ago, when very few encoded texts existed; as a result, the TEI Guidelines were developed in large part in the absence of prior experience and practice.",
        "Given the benefit of the TEI experience and the initiation of many corpus-encoding projects over the past ten years, the CES can approach the development of a standard for encoding linguistic corpora from a different perspective.",
        "In particular, the CES is being developed incrementally, evolving as consensus and best practice emerge within the community.",
        "Accordingly, the CES so far includes specifications for basic document structure, sentences, words, and several other sub-paragraph elements, as well as encoding conventions for incorporating part of speech and alignment information.",
        "t'We are working on extending the CES for additional kinds of markup (terminology, speech, discourse, lexicons, etc.",
        "), but we rely on user input and established practice for continued development of the scheme.",
        "Most data encoded for NLP work is adapted from legacy data, that is, preexisting electronic data encoded in some arbitrary format (typically, word processor, typesetter, etc.",
        "formats intended for printing).",
        "This process, called up-translation, involves translating existing encoding, that describes the printed presentation of the text (e.g., font shifts, page breaks, etc.)",
        "into an encoding which is suitable as a basis for general use.",
        "The resulting encoding uses descriptive markup to identify the logical and structural parts of a text.",
        "Because up-translation is common and costly, the CES provides guidelines for the process.",
        "In general, it is e'descriptive markup that is important for corpus-based research, and information about rendition in a printed original can or even must be ignored.",
        "For example, if the abbreviation for \"number\" (No.)",
        "is rendered sometimes with a superscripted \"o\" and sometimes not, a search on a document that retains the text in its original rendition will not identify the two as instances of the same linguistic element.",
        "However, for some applications it is necessary to retain certain information about printed rendering (e.g., in machine translation, where the resurtinot' translated text must be rendered in the same fonts, etc.--but obviously not with the same line breaks--as the original).",
        "Therefore, the CES recommends retaining rendition information when it is cost-free or when it is required, but provides means to retain it while appropriately representing the content for the purposes of search and retrieval."

        "The minimization of the costs of corpus creation is a primary goal of the CES.",
        "The vast quantities of data involved and the difficulty (and cost) of up-translation into usable formats dictate that the CES be designed in such a way that this translation does not require prohibitively large amounts of manual intervention to achieve minimum conformance to the standard.",
        "However, the markup that is most desirable for the linguist is not achievable by fully automatic means.",
        "Therefore, a major feature of the CES is the provision for a series of increasingly refined encodings of text, beyond the minimum requirements.",
        "The first level of encoding is the minimum level required to make the corpus (re)usable across all possible language processing applications.",
        "Encoding at this level includes elements often signalled by typography in the original (e.g., paragraph breaks) and is therefore achievable by fairly inexpensive, automated means.",
        "Successive encoding levels provide for increasing enhancement in the amount of encoded information and increasing precision in the identification of text elements.",
        "Automatic methods to achieve markup at each level are for the most part increasingly complex, and therefore more costly; the sequence is designed to accommodate a series of increasingly information-rich instantiations of the text at a minimum of cost.",
        "Section 3 outlines the precise requirements for each level of encoding defined by the CES.",
        "The CES is also designed based on processing considerations and needs, such as the overhead of use of SGML mechanisms (e.g., entity replacement, use of optional features), as well as more complex textual phenomena such as linkage among elements and related information (for example, annotation, phonetic gloss, etc.",
        "), which can have more serious implications for processing (e.g., the use of inter-textual pointers demands that the entire corpus be available at all times for processing).",
        "It also considers processing demands of end",
        "use, such as the ability to (efficiently) select • distribution of the base document may be texts according to user-specified criteria, etc.",
        "controlled, but the markup is freely available.",
        "There are additional problems involved in allowing for the simultaneous representation of, and selected access to, multiple views of a document, whereby it may be seen as a logical structure, a rhetorical structure, a linguistic object, a document database, etc., all of which are potentially conflicting in terms of well-formed, hierarchical markup.",
        "The CES addresses this problem as well as several others by defining a data architecture for corpora in which annotation information is not merged with the original, but rather retained in separate SGML documents (with different DTDs) and linked to the original or other annotation documents.",
        "This is opposed to the classical view of a document prepared for use in corpus-based research, in which annotation is added incrementally to the original as it is generated.",
        "The separation of original data and annotation is consistent with other recently developed data architecture models, such as the TIPSTER model.",
        "The separate markup strategy is in essence a finely linked hypertext format where the links signify a semantic role rather than navigational options.",
        "That is, the links signify the locations where markup contained in a given annotation document would appear in the document to which it is linked.",
        "As such the annotation information comprises remote markup which is virtually added to the document to which it is linked.",
        "In principle, the two documents could be merged to form a single document containing all the markup in each.",
        "This approach has several advantages for corpus-based research:",
        "• the base document may be read-only and/or very large, so copying it to introduce markup may be unacceptable; • the markup may include multiple overlapping hierarchies;6 • it may be desirable to associate alternative annotations (e.g., part-of-speech annotation using several different schemes, or representing different phases of analysis) with the base document; • it avoids the creation of potentially unwieldy documents; 6 For example, lines and sentences in poerty, transcriptions of multi-party dialogues, multimedia corpora, etc."

        "The cesAlign DID defines the annotation document containing alignment information for parallel texts.",
        "It consists entirely of links between the documents that have been aligned.",

        "Alignment may be between two or more such documents, which are identified in the header of the alignment document.",
        "The most common situation in aligning parallel translations is to align data that comprises the content of an entire SGML element, such as an <s>, <per>., or <tok> element.",
        "Especially when the aligned data is notintheSGMLoriginal document, it is likely that the elements to be associated will have id attributes by which they can be referenced in the alignment document, in order to specify the elements to be aligned or \"linked\".",
        "Note that when the SGML II) and IDref mechanism is used to point from one element U3 another in the same SGML document, the SGML parser will validate the references to ensure that every 'MIT points VD a valid II).",
        "In the DES, all alignment documents are separate from the documents that are being aligned, and therefore this validation of IDrefs by the SGML parser is lost.",
        "However, other software may be used UD validate cross-document references, if necessary.",
        "The CES provides a simple means to point to SGML elements in other SGML documents by referring to IDs or any other unique identifying attribute on dume elements, using the xtargets attribute on the <link> element.",
        "Here is a simple example:",
        "When the data to be linked does not include IDs on relevant elements (or for some reason it is not desired to use IDrefs for alignment), or when the data to be linked is not the entire content of an SGML element, it is necessary to",
        "reference locations in the documents using the CES notation, which consists of a combination of ESIS tree location and character offset.",
        "Conclusion By far the greatest need for the development of linguistic corpora is to ensure their usability and reusability in integrated platforms.",
        "This demands (at least): • the development and use of consistent and coherent encoding formats for data representation, as well as standardized schemes for annotation of linguistic information; • the development of reusable, integrated systems and tool architectures for language processing and analysis, including the corresponding development of a data architecture to best suit research needs.",
        "It is imperative that these activities be undertaken in collaboration.",
        "For example, an encoding format that maximizes processability and retrievability must be devised in view of the capabilities and architecture of the tools that will handle them; similarly, reusable tool design must be informed by full knowledge of the nature and representation of linguistic information, desired processes, etc.",
        "The development of the CES is an attempt to achieve this kind of integration between the development of encoding schemes and corpus processing and use.",
        "Very little study has been made to date of the relation between encoding conventions and the demands of processing and retrieval, despite the fact that with the development of digital libraries and web-based document delivery, consideration of these relationships is critical.",
        "The CES is in some sense an experiment to develop a principled basis for further work on this topic; it is in no way intended to be the complete and final answer to the problem.",
        "Rather, the CES is being developed from the bottom-up, by starting with a relatively minimal set of encoding conventions and successively incorporating feedback to enlarge the standard as needed by the language processing community, and as processing and retrieval needs become better understood.",
        "Testing of the current CES specifications and feedback are both invited and encouraged, as well input and suggestions concerning the treatment of other areas of corpus encoding."
