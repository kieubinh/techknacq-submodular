        "Adequate text processing systems have become widely available for most natural languages.",
        "While English remains the dominant language on the Internet, the relative share of other languages now appears to be on the rise.",
        "The network has become truly multilingual.",
        "This situation has created an acute need for tools capable of performing language-sensitive search in multilingual databases.",
        "In particular, there is a need for tools capable of performing cross-language information retrieval (CUR), that is, of matching an information query written in one particular language with documents that may be written in one or several different languages.",
        "Given such a need, the solution that immediately comes to mind is to translate the information query using a machine translation (MT) system, and to feed the resulting translation into a classical monolingual IR system.",
        "However, it should be stressed that MT and IR have widely divergent concerns.",
        "First, observe that MT systems are expected to produce syntactically correct translations and that they tend to spend a lot of effort trying to attain that rather elusive goal.",
        "On the other hand, current IR systems tend not to care about grammar : for them texts are mostly viewed as vectors of content words.",
        "Second, note that MT systems are expected to select one of the many translations that words may have.",
        "For example, in translating the English word \"organic\" the MT process will be led to select between the French words \"organique\" and\"biologique\".",
        "Generally speaking, this selection process is very difficult and MT systems often end up selecting the wrong target language equivalent.",
        "Here again what the MT system is expected to do turns out to be unnecessary and maybe undesirable from an IR point of view.",
        "As a case in point, classical IR systems often perform a query expansion process by which certain query terms/words are mapped onto several equivalent or related index terms.",
        "Not surprisingly, such a process could well make provision for mapping the query word \"organique\" onto the two index terms \"organique\" and \"biologique\" so as to account for (partial) synonymy between these words.",
        "In other words, MT systems attempt to systematically eradicate translational ambiguity instead of taking advantage of it to capture synonymy relations.",
        "At the opposite end of the spectrum, MT is replaced with a simple bilingual dictionary lookup.",
        "To that end, one can use either an ordinary general-purpose dictionary, a technical terminology database, or both.",
        "Because of the fact that in any sizable dictionary most words receive many",
        "translations, the dictionary approach will in effect subject the query to a rather massive expansion process.",
        "The resulting target language query is likely engender a lot of noise (irrelevant documents that get retrieved), mostly due to the fact that in each dictionary entry some of the translations can correspond to different meanings of the source language word.",
        "For example, the English word \"drug\" is translated in French as \"drogue\" (an illegal substance) or as \"m6dicament\" (a legal medicine) depending on the context.",
        "There is most often no explicit clue in the query that would allow one to choose the appropriate meaning.",
        "Yet another approach is to determine translational equivalence automatically, on the basis of a corpus of parallel texts (that is, a corpus made up of source texts and their translations).",
        "One way of doing this is to start by establishing translation correspondences between units larger than words, typically sentences.",
        "There are now well-known methods for aligning the sentences of parallel corpora (Gale & Church [6], Simard, Foster cgi Isabelle [10]).",
        "Then, the translational equivalence of a given pair of words can be estimated by their degree of co-occurrence in parallel sentences.",
        "Compared to the previous approaches, this has the following advantages: - There is no need to acquire or to compile a bilingual dictionary or a complete MT system.",
        "- Word translations are made sensitive to the domain, as embodied by the training corpus.",
        "- As we will see below, it is relatively easy to obtain a suitable degree of query expansion based on translational ambiguity.",
        "In the next section, we describe the structure of a probabilistic translation model that can calculate p(file), the probability of observing word fj as part of the translation of sentence e. Given a query e, we can then select the n best-scoring values off; as the set of index terms in the target language.",
        "This method will be compared to the other two mentioned above."

        "Any source language input e can usually be translated in a great many different ways.",
        "Machine translation systems are expected to select but one particular translation f for each input.",
        "In the current state of the art, unaided MT is generally unable to produce high-quality translations: human translators remain mostly unchallenged.",
        "Moreover, it has been shown repeatedly that human translators seldom find it practical to post-edit MT output: the machine has just made too many wrong or questionable decisions.",
        "If the goal is to help human translators, it is advisable to stop short of producing a full-blown automatic translation.",
        "There is no point in having the machine spontaneously propose a detailed target language syntactic structure unless there is at least a reasonably good chance that the translator will want to use it.",
        "Similarly, there is no point in having the machine select target language equivalents for all source language words unless most of these equivalents are likely to be retained by the translator.",
        "In recent years it has been shown that existing MT techniques can produce useful results when they are applied to tasks that amount to somewhat less than translation proper.",
        "In previous work, we have shown that probabilistic translation models such as those of Brown et al.",
        "[2] could be used as the key component of various translation support tools.",
        "Specifically, our work on the TransTalk project [1, 4] has established that such models could become instrumental in improving the process of automatically transcribing a spoken translation.",
        "And our ongoing work on the TransType project [5] indicates that models of the same kind can drive typing aids for translators.",
        "A key feature of such applications is that they do not expect the machine to volunteer a full-fledged translation on its own.",
        "Rather, the machine is only expected to restrict the range of possible translations so as to make it easier to guess what the intentions of the human translator are.",
        "For example, in certain incarnations of the TransTalk system, the translation model is used as a means of answering the following question: given a source language sentence e, what is the likelihood of observing the word!",
        "in any target language sentence f that constitutes a valid translation of e?",
        "If e is an English sentence that contains the word \"horses\", then the likelihood that \"chevaux\" (the most direct equivalent for \"horses\") will appear in a French translation f of e is much",
        "greater than the a priori likelihood of observing \"chevaux\" in a random French sentence.",
        "In contrast, there is no reason to expect that the likelihood of observing \"cheveux\" (an acoustically close word that means \"hair\") in f will be significantly altered:",
        "TransTalk makes use of this fact to help resolve the acoustic ambiguity between the French words \"chevaux\" and \"cheveux\".",
        "From the point of view of translation support, doing somewhat less than full-blown MT is likely to achieve more.",
        "In this paper, we want to argue that CLIR is facing a similar situation in that subjecting the source language query to a process that stops short of producing a full-blown target language query can result in a good retrieval performance.",
        "For the purpose of CLIR, our goal is to obtain a set of words that are the best translations of an original query.",
        "This goal may be achieved by using probabilistic translation models of the kind used in our TransTalk and TransSearch.",
        "By translation model, we mean a mechanism which associates to each source language sentence (or query) e a probability distribution p(fle) on the sentences (or queries) f of the target language.",
        "A precise description of a family of such models can be found in Brown & al.",
        "[2].",
        "The model we will be using for the experiments reported here is basically their \"Model 1\".",
        "In this model, a source e and its translation f are connected through an alignment a, that is a mapping of the words of e onto those of f'.",
        "If e = e,, e, and f = fr f „, then a, will be used to refer to the particular position in e that is connected with position j in f (for example, a, = 4 expresses the fact that f, is connected with e,) and e,,, will be used to refer to the word in e at position a1.",
        "The probability p(fle) is decomposed as a sum over all possible alignments: P(fle) = /ae AP(: ale) The conditional probability of f under alignment a given e can be analysed as follows:",
        "The latter equality stems from the fact that in model 1, all alignments are considered equiprobable (see below).",
        "Consequently p(ale) is a constant Ke equal to 1 over the total number of alignements.",
        "The core of the model is t(f,le,), the lexical probability that some word e. translated as word 4.",
        "The value of p(fla,e) depends mostly on the product of the lexical probabilities of each word pair connected by the alignment:",
        "where Cr,.",
        "is a constant that accounts for certain dependencies between the respective lengths of sentences e and f (mostly irrelevant here).",
        "The probability of observing word f, in f under a particular alignment a is:",
        "And the probability of observing word f, in f under any alignment is:",
        "Since all alignments are considered equiprobable, we can simply sum up the values obtained by connecting f, to each word e„ e„ e, of e. In other words, the probability of observing a particular word in a given position in f is established as the total of the lexical contributions of each word of e. The parameters of our translation model are estimated from a bilingual parallel corpus in which each sentence has been aligned with the corresponding sentence(s) of the other language.",
        "Such alignments can be produced using algorithms such as the one described in [10].",
        "Given such alignments we can estimate reasonable values for the parameters t(file,) using the Expectation Maximization algorithm, as described in [2].",
        "The model used in the experiments reported here has been trained using 8 years of the Canadian Hansard (parliamentary debates),is, that approximately 50 million words in each language.",
        "Obviously, a translation model in which all alignments are considered equiprobable, like Model 1, can only be a very coarse model.",
        "The lexical translation probabilities t(f/le,) are independent from the positions of f, and e,.",
        "As a result, for any j, j', the model assigns the",
        "same value to p(ftle) and to p(file).",
        "In other words, the model is completely blind to syntax.",
        "This means that it is much too weak to generate full-blown translations on its own.",
        "At the very least, one would need to use it in tandem with a language model p(f) capable of capturing some constraints on acceptable sequences of words in the target language.",
        "Notwithstanding its weaknesses Model 1 does capture some non trivial aspects of the translation relationship as we observe it across natural languages.",
        "For example, it is indeed a property of that model that a relatively unambiguous source language word (say, the English \"chimney\") will reinforce its equivalents in a stronger way than a very ambiguous word.",
        "An ambiguous word like \"drug\" will reinforce each of its equivalents (\"medicament\" and \"drogue\") according to a translation probability estimated from the training corpus.",
        "While the model only operates at the level of simple word (as opposed to complex terms), it should be observed that it nonetheless captures some non-trivial contextual effects.",
        "For example, if the training corpus contains many occurrences of the expression \"drug traffic\" translated as \"trafic de drogue\", the presence of the English word \"traffic\" will thereafter tend to reinforce the French word \"drogue\" (in this instance, more than the French word \"medicament\").",
        "And given the fact that the intended application is not MT but CUM, the use of a \"weak\" translation model turns out to be, in some respects, sufficient.",
        "In our IR system queries and documents are reperesented as vectors of weighted terms.",
        "Given any query e, our translation model will calculate a value for p(ftle), the probability of observing word f; in the translation of e. It turns out to be straightforward to reinterpret this probability distribution as a vector of weighted terms."

        "This is because in the Hansard corpus, the English \"drug\" refers more often to the sense \"medicament\" than to \"drogue\".",
        "2) This dependence on the training corpus sometimes leads to odd translations.",
        "For example, the word \"bille\" is considered as a French translation of \"logging\" in the English query \"effects of logging on desertification\".",
        "This translation comes from the fact that in the Hansard corpus \"log\" in English is often translated as \"bille de bois\" in French.",
        "3) Some words are rare or even absent in our training corpus, and this leads to unreliable translations.",
        "For example, there was only one occurrence of \"acupuncture\" in the training corpus.",
        "Because of that, the model fails to assign a higher probability to the French \"acuponcture\" than to other semantically unrelated words that appeared in the same sentence.",
        "4) The model sometimes fail to distinguish the real translation from noise induced by simple statistical associations.",
        "For example, the word \"prendre\" appears in the translations of queries 1 and 3.",
        "It is attributed with even higher probabilities than the true translation words of the query such as \"second\", \"action\" and \"stupefiant\".",
        "Statistics alone may prove insufficient for tackling this problem correctly.",
        "Despite these problems, we observe that real translations and associated words tend to score relatively high and appear at the top of the list.",
        "When the probabilities are incorporated into the query vector used to retrieve documents, the documents containing these words will be retrieved in priority.",
        "What use should we make of the probabilities that our translation model associates to each word?",
        "Should we use them directly as the weights appearing in our query vector?",
        "Should we rather combine them with other information?",
        "Notice that the probabilities assigned by the translation model are related to the y.",
        "(term frequency) criterion of IR: our definition of p(f; le) is such that each individual occurrence of a word e. the query e will reinforce the fi's that are likely translations for e,.",
        "However, our translation model has little to say about the other criterion that is so important in IR: idf (inverse document frequency).",
        "One possible way to derive a g*idf-like weighting is to use the following transformed weight in the query vector: = p(fl e) * log(N/n) where p(f.I e)is the probability obtained by the probabilistic translation model, and log(N/n) represents the idf criterion as described in section 3.1.",
        "In our experiments, we tested different lengths of the list of translation words, as well as the two weighting methods in query vectors.",
        "The following table shows the IR effectiveness obtained in different cases.",
        "We observe that when the length of the translation word list increases from 10 to 50, the retrieval effectiveness increases slightly.",
        "However, when the length becomes too high (100), the effectiveness declines.",
        "This phenomenon may be explained as follows: the more words we retain in the translation: 1) the more related words get to be included; but 2) the more unrelated words get to be included as well.",
        "A good compromise is needed.",
        "Comparing lists of length 100 with shorten ones confirms our intuition that ignoring words with low probabilities reduces the risk of incorrect word associations, thus the risk of retrieving irrelevant documents.",
        "It is also evident that the transformed weighting which takes into account the idf-criterion produces better results than translation probabilities alone.",
        "This is just another confirmation of the importance of the idf-criterion in IR.",
        "To compare with the systems participating in the T'REC-6 trial, we evaluated our system using transformed weight, at the lengths of 20 and 50.",
        "We obtain 29.71% and 29.97% in performance respectively.",
        "We mentioned above that our probabilistic translation model is sometimes unable to distinguish true translations from accidental statistical associations.",
        "We thought it might help to incorporate additional evidence of a true translation relationship if any such evidence was available.",
        "It is often the case in IR that combining different sources of evidence increases IR effectiveness.",
        "This is why we tried combining our probabilistic translation model with the bilingual dictionary mentioned above.",
        "Combining the probabilistic translation model with a bilingual dictionary A problem arises in such a combination due to the different nature of each element: one is weighted and the other is not.",
        "In other words, the question is the following: if a French word is a translation of an English word in the bilingual dictionary, how much should we increase the weight (probability) of this translation in the probabilistic model ?",
        "Our goal was not to provide a theoretically well founded answer to that question but simply to see if a simple-minded solution would prove useful in practice.",
        "We tested the following approach: when a French translation is stored in the bilingual dictionary, its probability is increased by a default value, a constant determined manually.",
        "The new \"probability\" is used to obtain the transformed weight for the query vector as before.",
        "We tested several default values, ranging from 0.005 to 0.05.",
        "The following table shows the IR effectiveness obtained in each case.",
        "First and foremost, note that in all cases the combined resources yield better retrieval effectiveness than either the probabilistic model alone or the bilingual dictionary alone.",
        "This strongly confirms our intuition that combining two sources of information should produce better results.",
        "In many of the tested cases the combined approach outperform the MT systems.",
        "In the case where the default value is 0,02, and 50 translation words are retained, we obtained the best effectiveness 29,85% (among all the tested cases).",
        "It may be claimed here that there are better tools for CUR than MT systems.",
        "For the 13 queries used in the TREC6 tests, we obtain 34.26% and 30.49% for the cases where the default value is set at 0.02, and the lengths at 20 and 50.",
        "These performances are excellent in comparing with the best systems at the TREC-6 conference (24.35%).",
        "Although the improvements in effectiveness of the combined approach over MT systems obtained so far are still small, we think that",
        "this approach may be further improved by 1) using a better training corpus; 2) using a more complete bilingual dictionary; and 3) a better method of combination.",
        "It is also possible to combine our probabilistic translation model with an MT system.",
        "As these two methods are based on different knowledge sources, the results could well prove superior too.",
        "We plan to examine this combination in the future."

        "Thus there is still a lot of room for further improvement.",
        "There may not be any single translation method that will fill the bill.",
        "We believe that progress is likely to come from combining various sources of translation knowledge and we intend to continue testing such methods in our future research."
