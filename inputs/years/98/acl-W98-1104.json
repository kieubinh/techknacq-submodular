        "Let D be the number of documents, Y' be the term frequency (what we call \"frequency\" in our field) and df be the document frequency (the number of documents which contain the word or phrase at least once).",
        "RIDF is defined as: Residual 1DF a observed IDF - predicted IDF = -log(df/D) +log(1-exp(- 0)) = -log(df/D) +log(1-exp(-tf/D)).",
        "RIDF is, in certain sense, like MI; both are the log of the ratio between an empirical observation and a chance-based estimate.",
        "Words or phrases with high RIDF or MI have distributions that cannot be attributed to chance.",
        "However, the two measures look for different kinds of deviations from chance.",
        "MI tends to pick out general vocabulary, the kind of words one would expect to find in a dictionary, whereas RIDF tends to pick out good keywords, the kind of words one would not expect to find in a dictionary.",
        "This distinction is not surprising given the history of the two measures; MI, as it is currently used in our field, came from lexicography whereas RIDF came from Information Retrieval.",
        "In addition, it is natural to compute RIDF for all substrings.",
        "This is generally not done for MI, though there are many ways that MI could be generalized to apply to longer ngrams.",

        "compute tf and df on the classes rather than on the substrings.",
        "There are two parts to this argument: every substring belongs to at most one class (property 3a), and every substring belongs to at least one class (property 3b).",
        "Demonstration of property 3a (proof by contradiction): Suppose there is a substring, s, that is a member of two classes: class(<ij>) and class(<u,v>).",

        "By construction, the interval <ij> is LCP-delimited (LBL(<itj>) < Psi and SIL(<ij>) ?_ Psi), and s is an element of class(<ij>).",
        "Finally, as mentioned above, computing over classes is much more efficient than computing over the substrings themselves because there are many fewer classes (at most 2N-1) than substrings (N(N+1)/2).",

        "There are N intervals <i,i>.",

        "To argue the second clause, we will make use of a uniqueness property: an LCP-delimited interval <ij> can be uniquely determined by its SIL and a representative element k (i 5_k<j).",
        "Suppose there were two distinct intervals, <ij> and <u,v>, with the same S I L, SIL(<u,v>), and the same representative, i.5./c<j and iik<v. Since they share a common representative, k, the two intervals must overlap.",
        "But since they are distinct, there must be a distinguishing element, d, that is in one but not the other.",
        "One of these distinguishing elements, d, would have to be a bounding lcp in one and an interior lcp in the other.",
        "But then the two intervals couldn't both be LCP-delimited.",
        "Given this uniqueness property, we can determine the N-1 upper bound on the number of LCP-delimited intervals by considering the N-1 elements in the lcp vector.",
        "Each of these elements, Icp[k], has the opportunity to become the SIL of an LCP-delimited interval <ij> with a representative k. Thus there could be as many as N-1 LCP-delimited intervals (though there could be fewer if some of the opportunities don't work out).",
        "Moreover, there couldn't be any more intervals with tf>l, because if there were one, its SIL should have been in the lcp vector.",
        "(Note that this lcp counting argument excludes intervals with tf=1 discussed above, because their SILs need not be in the lcp vector.)",
        "From property 4, it follows that there are at most N distinct values of RIDF.",
        "The N intervals <i,i> have just one RIDF value since tf=dfr--1 for these intervals.",
        "The other N-1 intervals could have another N-1 RIDF values.",
        "In summary, the four properties taken collectively make it practical to compute tf, df and RIDF over a relatively small number of classes; it would have been prohibitively expensive to compute these quantities directly over the N(N+1)/2 substrings."
