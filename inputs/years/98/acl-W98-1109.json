        "In the ACRONYM Project, we have taken the Firthian view (e.g. Firth 1957) that context is part of the meaning of the word, and measured similarity of meaning between words through second-order collocation.",
        "Using large-scale, free text corpora of UK journalism, we have generated collocational data for all words except for high-frequency grammatical words, and have found that semantically related word pairings can be identified, whilst syntactic relations are disfavoured.",
        "We have then moved on to refine this system, to deal with multi-word terms and identify changing conceptual relationships across time.",
        "The system, conceived in the late 80's and developed in 1994-97, differs from others of the 90's in purpose, scope, methodology and results, and comparisons will be drawn in the course of the paper."

        "The team at Liverpool has created over the years a series of automated systems for handling and extracting information from large textual corpora.",
        "These systems consist of software and knowledge bases derived from those same textual resources.",
        "Most recently, the system known as ACRONYM (Automated Collocational Retrieval of `Nyrris') has involved the identification of conceptually related items.",
        "These are referred to as `nyms', by analogy with `synonyms' and other sense related items, as a reflection of the fact that it is conceptual similarity that is being discovered through collocation.",
        "Like its predecessors, the ACRONYM system has a dual purpose.",
        "On the one hand, it is intended to generate pairs or clusters of items which can function as alternative search terms in a diachronic text retrieval environment.",
        "On the other, it is intended to support a description of the thesaurus in text.",
        "In the latter application, the precise nature of the nyms generated by a given target word is important.",
        "The basic system for identifying conceptual relations The starting point for the nymic identification system is the raw text from which thesaural relations are to be derived.",
        "This corpus currently contains over 300 million words from The Independent newspaper from 1988 to 1997.",
        "As with similar work (e.g. Brown et al. 1992), the size of the corpus makes preprocessing such as lemmatization, POS tagging or partial parsing, too costly.",
        "The sole preprocessing performed on the corpus is thus the relabelling of numeric tokens into general categories.",
        "During this preprocessing stage, the corpus is also integerised and indexed.",
        "This increases efficiency during later processing stages, in particular the creation of the collocate database.",
        "Within the system, collocates are by default defined as the four words to the left and right of every word.",
        "The only exceptions to this rule are that collocates are not recorded for a set of 253 stopwords (high frequency terms; grammatical words, numeric labels and some verbs), and these are also not recorded as collocates of any other word.",
        "The raw frequencies of left and right span collocates for a given word-pair are merged, and their significance measured, using a Z-score statistic.",
        "Statistically significant collocates are then stored as a sparse matrix in the collocate database.",
        "A corpus of 3 x 108 words and 1.5 x 106 word types produces just over 4.8 x 106 statistically significant collocates (using a liberal threshold for significance).",
        "We refer to the set of statistically significant collocates for a given word as a 'collocational profile'.",
        "Similarity between any",
        "two given words is 'then measured through comparison of their prc files; the measure itself is based on the size of tae profiles of both words and the number of collocates they share (i.e., second order collocation), and also on the collocation between those two words (first order colloclation).",
        "The definition of 'what constitutes first-order collocation differs for different researchers.",
        "For example, the corpus described in Grefensttette (1992) is comparatively small, allowing for extensive preprocessing, including POS tagging and partial parsing.",
        "Only modifiers and their modified nouns are recorded as collocating pairs, allowing for a more fine-grained analysis, of just a subset of word classes.",
        "In contrast, Schiitze and Pedersen (1995) treat the set of collocates for a word as a vector containing the frequencies of collocation with other words occurring within a 40-word window.",
        "Futrelle and Gauch (1993) use a similar approach but preserve positional information (i.e., the number of words to the left and right of the target word).",
        "Positional information is also retained by Brown et al. (1992), who store collocation information as word n-grams.",
        "For very large corpora, a lot of collocational information will be generated, making any form of collocational similarity measurement computationally expensive.",
        "Again, researchers have adopted differing approaches to this problem.",
        "Schiitze and Pedersen (1995) build their collocate vectors using a bootstrap method involving increasingly larger sets of the lexicon, finally constructing a low (20) dimensional word vector space by Singular Value Decomposition.",
        "A simpler method is employed by Futrelle and Gauch (1993), whereby collocate vectors are recorded for all word forms, but for each word form, only its frequency of co-occurrence with the top 150 most frequent word forms is recorded.",
        "The researchers use a 2-word window to the left and right of the target word,.",
        "but they also preserve the positional information of the collocates, resulting in a 600-dimension word-vector of mutual information measurements.",
        "While there are many different ways to record collocates, the primary difference between the ACRONYM collocate database and those detailed above is the omission both of collocation involving grammatical function words, and of positional information.",
        "By omitting these two elements, the resulting collocate database focuses less on the syntagmatic similarity between words and more on their paradigmatic relations."

        "The definition and purpose of word similarity measures in the above systems also differ.",
        "Vector-based models define similarity as the cosine measure between two words, and the purpose of Schiitze and Brown's vector-based work is to cluster grammatical word classes automatically.",
        "Mutual information-based approaches, such as those of Brown et al. (1992) and Futrelle and Gauch (1993), measure word similarity in the context of a set of words to be clustered, typically with the aim of clustering for general similarity.",
        "The Jaccard coefficient measurement offered by Grefenstette (1992) is the nearest to our own, defining similarity simply in terms of the number of shared 'attributes' between two words against the number of attributes of both.",
        "While Schiitze and Pedersen (1993), Brown et al. (1992) and Futrelle and Gauch (1993) all demonstrate the ability of their systems to identify word similarity using clustering on the most frequently occurring words in their corpus, only Grefenstette (1992) demonstrates his system by generating word similarities with respect to a set of target words.",
        "His purpose is to allow a user to specify a target word, and have the system return an ordered list of related words.",
        "To this extent, the purpose of the basic ACRONYM system is echoed in Grefenstette's work.",
        "Given the liberal thresholds currently used in the ACRONYM system, such a list of conceptually related words may contain several tens of thousands of entries.",
        "As the size of the lexicon renders it computationally infeasible to calculate all word-pair similarities in advance, the system generates word similarity measures for a given word on the fly, using the collocate database described above.",

        "Grefenstette hypothesised that any system identifying shared collocation between words would pick up the Deese antonyms as being strongly related; he experimented by feeding the 'primer' word for each of those antonym ; into his SEXTANT system, and listing the ID most closely related words produced.",
        "The same 'primer' words were fed into the refined ACRONYM system, i.e. with first-order collocates suppressed, and the results are displayed in Table 3 on the next page.",

        "Similarly, as with Grefenstette's findings, there are cases where ACRONYM yields a non-Deese antonym which is nevertheless close: see for instance: big-small; dark-pale; deep-surface; happy-unhappy; new-existing; old-modern.",
        "A scrutiny of the actual contents of each ACRONYM list further reveals that, like Futrelle and Gauch, ACRONYM when using the particular non collocate upweighting method discovers \"... (entire) graded fields, rather than just pairs of opposites\".",
        "Of particular interest in this respect are the results for big, easy, fast and strong.",
        "For some words in Table 3, failure to relate closely to their Deese antonym can in part be explained by textual domain.",

        "ACRONYM uses two publicly available clustering tools, PAM and AGNES, described in Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990).",

        "The team first explored the way in which language changes over time in the AVIATOR Project (Renouf 1993, Collier 1993, Blackwell 1993), where they investigated the dynamic aspects not only of single words, but also of the collocational behaviour of those words, with the goal of identifying new collocations or changes in meaning.",
