        "Later on.",
        "linguists mostly studied grammars, which focussed on generalities and regularities, and led to the formulation of strong theories.",
        "and to the study of similarity across languages.",

        "edu Empirically-induced models that learn a linguistically meaningful grammar (Collins, 1997) seem to give the best practical results in statistical natural language processing.",
        "One of the reasons why these models perform so well compared to probabilistic context-free grammars is that they incorporate detailed lexical knowledge at all points in the derivation (Charniak, 1997).",
        "At the same time they perform better than string-based approaches because they retain structural knowledge.",
        "such as phrase structure, subcategorization and long distance dependencies.",
        "So they are equally capable of modelling the fine lexical idiosyncrasies and the more general syntactic regularities.",
        "Given an annotated training corpus, such methods learn its distributions (the lexical co-occurrences), which requires being given the correct space of events in the model – that is, the grammar – accurately enough that they can parse new instances of the same corpus.",
        "The success of such models suggests that a statistical model must have access to the appropriate linguistic features to make accurate predictions.",
        "We might want to ask the question: what happens if what one wants to do with annotated text is not to annotate more text, but to perform some other task?",
        "Are the same insights valid, so that annotated text can be used to help in other tasks.",
        "for instance generation or translation?",
        "Can we use annotated text to investigate properties of language(s) systematically?",
        "In other words, call we use annotated text as a repository of information?",
        "The answer is a qualified yes.",

        "ing corpora useful for other tasks might require more a priori information than expected.",
        "Precisely, we ask the following question: are the percentages of occurrence of linguistically-defined units in a large corpus in accord with what, is known about preferences for these units collected in other ways, such as unedited sentence production, experimental findings, or intuitive native speakers' judgments?",
        "This question is relevant as there is evidence in the literature of human parsing preferences that is in apparent disagreement with predictions of preferences derived from frequencies in a corpus (Brysbaert et al., 1998).",
        "Beside the interest in modelling human performance (which is, however, not, the focus of the current paper), it.",
        "is important to investigate the sources of this disagreement between production preference data (frequencies in a text) and perception data (parsing preferences by humans), if the plentiful information stored in text is to be used successfully.",
        "Distributional properties of texts if understood, can be used to approximate resolution of ambiguity in several tasks which involve deeper natural language understanding: a generation system can use distributional properties to reproduce users' preference data; automatic translation can use monolingual distributions to model cross-linguistic variation accurately, and automatic lexical acquisition can use distributional properties of text to bootstrap a process of organisation of lexical information.",
        "The method we use to address the question is as follows.",
        "We present a large in-depth corpus-based case study (65 million words of WSJ) to investigate (1) how the structure of a grammar is reflected in a corpus, and (2) how probability functions defined according to a grammar fit native speakers' linguistic behaviour in syntactic disambiguation.",
        "We look at the well-known case of the ambiguity between a main clause and a reduced relative construction, which arises because regular verbs in English present an ambiguity between the simple past and the past particle (the -ed form).",

        "the following noun phrase and knowledge about whether the noun phrase was the direct object, of the verb or not (transitive-intransitive), the preceding noun phrase and knowledge about whether the noun phrase was the subject of the verb or rather an adjunct head (MV/reduced relative), and the preceding determiner (adjective-non-adjective).",

        "An LTAG lexicon is a forest of lexicalised elementary trees.",
        "For verbs, the tree structure corresponds to their argument structure.",
        "Thus, each of the lexical items and portion of tree mentioned above correspond to a different elementary tree, including the unergative and unaccusative distinction.",

        "LTAG part-of-speech taggers, called supertag-gers (Josh i and Srinivas, 1994; Srinivas, 1997) assign a set of elementary trees to each word, in effect chunking the text.",
        "The counts performed in the study reported here would have required simply counting the occurrences of the labels assigned to the words in the text by such a su-pertagger.",
        "Refinements in this direction of the annotation of the grammar used by the XTAG system (Doran et al., 1994) are actually under way.",
        "We also can see, from the raw frequencies obtained, that when collecting counts about syntactic phenomena, corpora must be in the order of hundreds of millions of words for the statistics to be reliable."
