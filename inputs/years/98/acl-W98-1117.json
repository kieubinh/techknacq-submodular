        "Given a set X of possible histories and a set Y of futures, we can characterise events from the joint event space X,Y by defining a number of features, i.e., equivalence relations over X x Y.",
        "By defining these features, we express our insights about information relevant to modelling.",
        "In such a formalisation, the maximum entropy technique consists in finding a model that (a) fits the empirical expectations of the predefined features, and (b) does not assume anything specific about events that are not subject to constraints imposed by the features.",
        "In other words, we search for the maximum entropy probability distribution pt:",
        "where P = {p:p meets the empirical feature expectations} and H(p) denotes the entropy of p. For parameter estimation, we can use the Improved Iterative Scaling (IS) algorithm (Berger et al., 1996), which assumes p to have the form:",
        "where f: X x Y {0, 1} is the indicator function of the i-th feature, Ai the weight assigned to this feature, and Z a normalisation constant.",
        "IIS iteratively adjusts the weights (As) of the features; the model converges to the maximum entropy distribution.",
        "One of the most attractive properties of the maximum entropy approach is its ability to cope with feature decomposition and overlapping features.",
        "In the following sections, we will show how these advantages can be exploited for partial parsing, i.e., the recognition of syntactic structures of limited depth."

        "An interesting feature of many partial parsers is that they recognise phrase boundaries mainly on the basis of cues provided by strictly local",

        "Regardless of whether or not abstractions such as phrases occur in the model, most of the relevant information is contained directly in the sequence of words and part-of-speech tags to be processed.",

        "In the Link Grammar framework (Lafferty et al., 1992; Della Pietra et al., 1994), strictly local contexts are naturally combined with long-distance information coming from long-range trigrarns.",

        "On the other hand, the Markov assumption underlying our approach means that only strictly local dependencies are recognised.",
