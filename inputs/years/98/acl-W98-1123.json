        "Identification of discourse structure can be extremely useful to natural language processing applications such as automatic text summarization or information retrieval (IR).",
        "For example, a summarization agent might chose to summarize each discourse segment separately.",
        "Also, segmentation of a document into blocks of topically similar text can assist a search engine in choosing to retrieve or highlight a segment in which a query term occurs.",
        "In this paper, we present a topical segmentation program that achieves a 10% increase in both precision and recall over comparable previous work.",
        "In addition to segmenting, the system also labels the function of discovered discourse",
        "segments as to their relevance towards the whole.",
        "It identifies 1) segments that contribute some detail towards the main topic of the input, 2) segments that summarize the key points, and 3) segments that contain less important information.",
        "We evaluated our segment classification as part of a summarization system that utilizes highly pertinent segments to extract key sentences.",
        "We investigated the applicability of this system on general domain news articles.",
        "Generally, we found that longer articles, usually beyond a three-page limit, tended to have their own prior segmentation markings consisting of headers or bullets, so these were excluded.",
        "We thus concentrated our work on a corpus of shorter articles, averaging roughly 800-1500 words in length: 15 from the Wall Street Journal in the Linguistic Data Consortium's 1988 collection, and 5 from the on-line The Economist from 1997.",

        "The task of determining segmentation breaks depends fundamentally on extracting useful topic information from the text.",
        "We extract three categories of information, which reflect the topical content of a text, to be referred to as terms for the remainder of the paper:",
        "1. proper noun phrases; 2. common noun phrases; 3. personal and possessive pronouns.",
        "In order to find these three types of terms, we first tag the text with part of speech (POS) information.",
        "Two methods were investigated for assigning POS tags to the text: 1) running a specialized tagging program or 2) using a simple POS table lookup.",
        "We chose to use the latter to assign tags for time efficiency reasons (since the segmentation task is often only a preprocessing stage), but optimized the POS table to favor high recall of the 3 term types, whenever possible2.",
        "The resulting system was faster than the initial prototype that used the former approach by more than a magnitude, with a slight decline in precision that was not statistically significant.",
        "However, if a large system requires accurate tags after segmentation and the cost of tagging is not an issue, then tagging should be used instead of lookup.",
        "2We based our POS table lookup on NYU's COMLEX (Grishman et al.",
        "1994).",
        "After simplifying-COMLEX's categories to only reflect information important to to our three term types, we flattened all multi-category words (i.e. \"jump\" as V or N) to a single category by a strategy motivated to give high term recall (i.e. \"jump\" maps to N, because NP is a term type.)",
        "Once POS tags have been assigned, we can retrieve occurrences of noun phrases by searching the document for this simple regular expression: (Adj I Noun)* Noun This expression captures a simple noun phrase without any complements.",
        "More complex noun phrases such as \"proprietor of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley\" are captured as three different phrases: \"proprietor\", \"Stag's Leap Wine Cellars\" and \"Napa Valley\".",
        "We deliberately made the regular expression less powerful to capture as many noun phrases as possible, since the emphasis is on high NP recall.",
        "After retrieving the terms, a post-processing phase combines related tokens together.",
        "For possessive pronouns, we merge each possessive with its appropriate personal pronoun (\"my\" or \"mine\" with \"I\", etc.)",
        "For noun phrases, we canonicalize noun phrases according to their heads.",
        "For example, if the noun phrases \"red wine\" and \"wine\" are found in a text, we subsume the occurrences of \"red wine\" into the occurrences of \"wine\", under the condition that there are no other \"wine\" headed phrases, such as \"white wine\".",
        "Finally, we perform thresholding to filter irrelevant words, following the guidelines set out by Justeson and Katz (1995).",

        "However, for these three categories of terms we noticed that the linking distance differs depending on the type of term in question, with proper nouns having the maximum allowable distance and the pronominal forms having the least.",
        "Proper nouns generally refer to the same entity, almost regardless of the number of intervening sentences.",
        "Common nouns often have a much shorter scope of reference, since a single token can be used to repeatedly refer to different instances of its class.",
        "Personal pronouns scope even more closely, as is expected of an anaphoric or referring expression where the referent can be, by definition, different over an active discourse.",

        "Front: a paragraph in which a link begins.",

        "The term appears a total of six times, as shown by the numbers in the central row.",
        "These occurrences have been grouped together into two term links, as joined by the \"x\"s. The bottom \"type\" line labels each paragraph with one of the four paragraph relations.",
        "We see that it is possible for a term to have multiple front or rear paragraphs, as illustrated, since a term's occurrences might be separated between disparate links.",
        "Then, for each of the four categories of paragraph labeling mentioned before, and for each of the three term types, we assign a different segmentation score, listed in Table 1, whose values were derived by training, to be discussed in section 1.2.4.",
        "For noun phrases, we assume that the introduction of the term is a point at which a new topic may start; this is Youmans's (1991) Vocabulary Management Profile.",
        "Similarly, when a term is no longer being used, as in rear paragraphs, the topic may be closed.",
        "This observation may not be as direct as \"vocabulary introduction\", and thus presumably not as strong a marker of topic change as the former.",
        "Moreover, paragraphs in which the link persists throughout indicate that a topic continues; thus we see a negative score assigned to during paragraphs.",
        "When we apply the same paragraph labeling to pronoun forms, the same rationale applies with some modifications.",
        "Since the majority of pronoun referents occur before the pronoun (i.e. anaphoric as opposed to cataphoric), we do not weigh the front boundary heavily, but instead place the emphasis on the rear.",
        "When we iterate the weighting process described above over each term, and total the scores assigned, we come up with a numerical score for an indication of which paragraphs are more likely to beh a topical boundary.",
        "The higher the numerical score, the higher the likelihood that the paragraph is a beginning of a new topical segment.",
        "The question then is what should the threshold be?",
        "To solve this problem, we zero-sum the weights for each individual term.",
        "To do this, we first sum the total of all scores assigned to any front, rear and during paragraphs that we have previously assigned a score to and then evenly distribute to the remaining no link paragraphs the negative of this sum.",
        "This ensures that the net sum of the weight assigned by the weighting of each term sums to zero, and thus the weighting of the entire article, also sums to zero.",
        "In cases where no link paragraphs do not exist for a term, we cannot perform zero-summing, and take the scores assigned as is, but this is in small minority of cases.",
        "This process of weighting followed by zero-summing is shown by the extending the \"wine\" example, in Figure 2b, as indicated by the score and zero lines.",
        "With respect to individual paragraphs, the summed score results in a positive or negative total.",
        "A positive score indicates a boundary, i.e. the beginning of a new topical segment, whereas a negative score indicates the continuation of a segment.",

        "In this paper we have shown how multi-paragraph text segmentation can model discourse structure by addressing the dual problems of computing topical text segments and subsequently assessing their significance.",
        "We have demonstrated a new algorithm that performs linear topical segmentation in an efficient manner that is based on linguistic principles.",
        "We achieve a 10% increase in accuracy and recall levels over prior work (Hearst 1994, 1997).",
        "Our evaluation corpus exhibited a weak level of agreement among judges, which we believe correlates with the low level of performance of automatic segmentation programs as compared to earlier published works (Hearst 1997).",
        "Additionally, we describe an original method to evaluate a segment's significance: a two part metric that combines a measure of a segment's generality based on statistical approaches, and a classification of a segment's function based on empirical observations.",
        "An evaluation of this metric established its utility as a means of extracting key sentences for summarization."
