        "Since their renaissance in the mid-1980s, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques have been successfully applied across a broad spectrum of problem domains such as pattern recognition and function approximation.",
        "However despite these capabilities, to an end user an ANN is an arcane web of interconnected input, hidden, and output units.",
        "Moreover an ANN solution manifests itself entirely as sets of numbers in the form of activation function parameters and weight vectors.",
        "As such a trained ANN offers little or no insight into the process by which it has arrived at a given result nor, in general, the totality of \"knowledge\" actually embedded therein.",
        "This lack of a capacity to provide a \"human comprehensible\" explanation is seen as a clear impediment to a more widespread acceptance of ANNs.",
        "In order to redress this situation, recently considerable effort has been directed towards providing ANNs with the requisite explanation capability.",
        "In particular a number of mechanisms, procedures, and techniques have been proposed and developed to extract the knowledge embedded in a trained ANN as a set of symbolic rules which in effect mimic the behaviour of the ANN.",
        "A recent survey conducted by Andrews et al.",
        "(1995) offered an insight into the modus operandi of a broad cross-section of such techniques.",
        "In this paper we focus on the extraction of grammatical rules from trained Artificial Neural Networks and, in particular, Elman-type recurrent networks (Elman, 1990).",
        "Unlike Giles & Omlin (1993 a,b) who used an ANN to simulate a deterministic Finite State Automaton (FSA) representing a regular grammar, we have extracted FSA's from a network trained on a natural language corpus.",
        "The output of k-means cluster analysis is converted to state-transition diagrams which represent the grammar learned by the network.",
        "We analyse the prediction and generalisation performance of the grammar."

        "The resulting corpus consists of 106 sentences ranging from three to eight words in length, average length 5.06 words.",

        "The categories, their abbreviations as used in the text and their percent frequencies are shown in Table 1.",

        "There are 62 distinct sentence sequences of which 43 occur only once, the rest being replicated.",

        "The networks were trained by standard backpropagation with momentum and state unit activations were NOT reset to zero on presentation of a sentence boundary.",
        "Two networks were trained, one having two hidden units and the other nine, until prediction error stopped declining.",

        "Transitions with thick arrows have a frequency count >20, transitions displayed with thin arrows have a frequency count of 5 to 20 and transitions with a frequency count <5 are not shown to preserve clarity.",
        "The states have been numbered in sequence according to the average word position of their associated inputs.",
        "For example states 2, 6 and 8 all occur following input of the NN category but they are distinguished in cluster analysis by the NN having an average word-position in the sentence of 3.1, 5.7 and 6.5 respectively.",
        "The states having highest correct prediction rate, S7 and S8, are associated with the ends of sentences.",

        "In other words, the network had acquired internal representations of temporal sequences of at least length 3.",
        "However because the hidden unit space had such low dimensionality, it could not be partitioned by the output layer to achieve accurate prediction.",
        "An FSA with 18 states derived from k-means clustering of hidden unit activations scored 60% on the original training data (Table 2).",
        "This compares with a score of 69% by the original network and a score of 62% when predicting with a trigram model.",
        "Although in theory, the trigram model requires the calculation of Schellhammer, Diederich, Towsey and Brugman 77 Knowledge Extraction and Recurrent Neural Nets 10,000 transition probabilities, it reduces to 42 transition rules.",
        "This compares with of 62 transitions rules incorporated into the 18-state FSA.",
        "Thus the trigram model is a more compact definition of the grammar.",
        "However, low frequency transitions can be trimmed from the FSA's with minimal loss of performance as is demonstrated for the 10-state FSA in Table 3.",
        "Correct choice of the 'rescue' state is important for the efficient performance of an FSA because it determines the FSA's ability to pick up the sentence structure after a missing transition.",
        "In order to automate the production of FSA's following cluster analysis, we require a heuristic for the choice of 'rescue' state.",
        "Our initial choice, that state whose inputs on average are closest to the beginning of the sentence, seems to be a reasonable heuristic in the absence of other information (Table 4).",
        "Likewise, choosing the highest frequency category (in our case, NN) as the 'rescue' output is also confirmed by our results because the FSA scores achieved on non-missing transitions are not much better than the total scores, despite 10-20% of missing transitions (Table 4).",
        "The use of domain knowledge, such as category frequencies, to bias weight initialisation is successful in reducing error faster in the early stages of learning.",

        "Quite often knowledge extracted from neural networks is in the form of propositional rules (Andrews et al., 1995) but these are not always the most appropriate format for explication of network learning.",
        "For example where the network has been required to induce a grammar, cluster analysis of hidden unit activations and preparation of an FSA is a powerful technique to explicate the learned grammar.",
        "However, for this particular task, there is a trade-off between comprehensibility of the FSA (fewer states means more comprehensible) and its predictive performance compared to the original neural network.",
        "In these experiments an FSA with 18-states performed almost as well as a trigram model.",
        "The trigram model had the advantage of compactness, but the FSA had the advantage of comprehensibility."
