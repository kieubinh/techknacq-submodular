        "Lexical chains capture the semantic relations between words that occur throughout a text.",
        "Each chain is a set of related words that captures a portion of the cohesive structure of a text.",

        "A survey, reported in Outing (1996), found that there were 1,115 commercial newspaper online services worldwide, 94% of which were on the World-Wide Web (WWW).",
        "Of these online newspapers, 73% are in North America.",
        "Outing predicted that the number of newspa- â€¢ pers online would increase to more than 2,000 by the end of 1997.",
        "The problem is that these services are not making full use of the hypertext capabilities of the WWW.",
        "The user may be able to navigate to a particular article in the current edition of an online paper by using hypertext links, but they must then read the entire article to find the information that interests them.",
        "These databases are \"shallow\" hypertexts; the documents that are being retrieved are dead ends in the hypertext, rather than offering starting points for explorations.",
        "In order to truly reflect the hypertext nature of the Web, links should to be placed within and between the documents.",
        "As Westland (1991) has pointed out, manually creating and maintaining the sets of links needed for a large-scale hypertext is prohibitively expensive.",
        "This is especially true for newspapers, given the volume of articles Work done at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Toronto produced every day.",
        "This could certainly account for the state of current WWW newspaper efforts.",
        "Aside from the time-and-money aspects of building such large hypertexts manually, humans are inconsistent in assigning hypertext links between the paragraphs of documents (Ellis et al., 1994; Green, 1997).",
        "That is, different linkers disagree with each other as to where to insert hypertext links into a document.",
        "The cost and inconsistency of manually constructed hypertexts does not necessarily mean that large-scale hypertexts can never be built.",
        "It is well known in the IR community that humans are inconsistent in assigning index terms to documents, but this has not hindered the construction of automatic indexing systems intended to be used for very large collections of documents.",
        "Similarly, we can turn to automatically constructed hypertexts to address the issues of cost and inconsistency.",
        "In this paper, we will describe a novel method for building hypertext links within and between newspaper articles.",
        "We have selected newspaper articles for two main reasons.",
        "First, as we stated above, there is a growing number of services devoted to providing this information in a hypertext environment.",
        "Second, many newspaper articles have a standard structure that we can exploit in building hypertext links.",
        "Most of the proposed methods for automatic hypertext construction rely on term repetition.",
        "The underlying philosophy of these systems is that texts that are related will tend to use the same terms.",
        "Our system is based on lexical chaining and the philosophy that texts that are related will tend to use related terms."

        "A lexical chain (Morris and Hirst, 1991) is a sequence of semantically related words in a text.",
        "For example, if a text contained the words apple andfruit, they would appear in a chain together, since apple is a kind offruit.",
        "Each word in a text may appear in only one chain, but a document will contain many chains, each of which captures a portion of the cohesive structure of the document.",
        "Cohesion",
        "is what, as Halliday and Hasan (1976) put it, helps a text \"hang together as a whole\".",
        "The lexical chains contained in a text will tend to delineate the parts of the text that are \"about\" the same thing.",
        "Morris and Hirst showed that the organization of the lexical chains in a document mirrors, in some sense, the discourse structure of that document.",
        "The lexical chains in a text can be identified using any lexical resource that relates words by their meaning.",
        "Our current lexical chainer (based on the one described by St-Onge, 1995) uses the WordNet database (Beckwith et al., 1991).",
        "The WordNet database is composed of synonym sets or synsets.",
        "Each synset contains one or more words that have the same meaning.",
        "A word may appear in many synsets, depending on the number of senses that it has.",
        "Synsets can be connected to each other by several different types of links that indicate different relations.",
        "For example, two synsets can be connected by a hypemym link, which indicates that the words in the source synset are instances of the words in the target synset.",
        "For the purposes of chaining, each type of link between WordNet synsets is assigned a direction of up, down, or horizontal.",
        "Upward links correspond to generalization: for example, an upward link from apple to fruit indicates that fruit is more general than apple.",
        "Downward links correspond to specialization: for example, a link from fruit to apple would have a downward direction.",
        "Horizontal links are very specific specializations.",
        "For example, the antonymy relation in WordNet is given a direction of horizontal, since it specializes the sense of a word very accurately, that is, if a word and its antonym appear in a text, the two words are very likely being used in the senses that are antonyms.",
        "Given these types of links, three kinds of relations are built between words: Extra strong An extra strong relation is said to exist between repetitions of the same word: i.e., term repetition.",
        "Strong A strong relation is said to exist between words that are in the same WordNet synset (i.e., words that are synonymous).",
        "Strong relations are also said to exist between words that have synsets connected by a single horizontal link or words that have synsets connected by a single IS-A or INCLUDES relation.",
        "Regular A regular relation is said to exist between two words when there is at least one allowable path between a synset containing the first word and a synset containing the second word in the WordNet database.",
        "A path is allowable if it is short (less than n links, where n is typically 3 or 4) and adheres to three rules:",
        "1.",
        "No other direction may precede an upward link.",
        "2.",
        "No more than one change of direction is allowed.",
        "3.",
        "A horizontal link may be used to move from an upward to a downward direction.",
        "When a word is processed during chaining, it is initially associated with all of the synsets of which it is a member.",
        "When the word is added to a chain, the chainer attempts to find connections between the synsets associated with the new word and the synsets associated with words that are already in the chain.",
        "Synsets that can be connected are retained and all others are discarded.",
        "The result of this processing is that, as the chains are built, the words in the chains are progressively sense-disambiguated.",
        "When an article has been chained, a description of the chains contained in the document is written to a file.",
        "Table 1 shows some of the chains that were recovered from an article about the trend towards \"virtual parenting\" (Shellenbarger, 1995).",
        "In this table, the numbers in parentheses show the number of occurrences of a particular word.",
        "The process of lexical chaining is not perfect, but if we wish to process articles quickly, then we must accept some errors or at least bad decisions.",
        "In our sample article, for example, chain 1 is a conglomeration of words that would have better been separated into different chains.",
        "This is a side effect of the current implementation of the lexical chainer, but even with these difficulties, we are able to perform useful tasks.",
        "We expect to address some of these problems in subsequent versions of the chainer, hopefully with no loss in efficiency."

        "Furthermore, we determined that the probability of obtaining results such as these by chance is less than 0.1.",
        "Our inability to achieve a significant result may be due to several implementation factors, described in Green (1997).",
        "Thus, we conclude that we need to replicate the experiment in order to gain further information about the relationship between the two kinds of inter-article links.",
        "Green 109 Automatically generating hypertext Unfortunately, we also cannot say that our intra-article links are useful in all cases, although they may provide some benefit to novice users of an information system.",
        "We believe that we need to replicate this study in order to draw firmer conclusions about the method's usefulness.",
        "One of the advantages of Allan's work (1995) in automatic hypertext generation is that the links between portions of two texts can be given a type that reflects what sort of link is about to be followed.",
        "We currently have no method for producing such typed links, but it may be the case that the relations between words from WordNet can be used to determine the type of some links.",
        "It is still not clear how much of our methodology depends on the structure of the newspaper articles that we are processing.",
        "Does this standard structure enhance our hypertext linking capabilities, or would the method perform equally well, given any well-written text to work with?",
        "We intend to see how well the method performs on other types of texts, possibly changing our methodology to cope with the loss of some structure.",
        "While other automatic hypertext generation methodologies have been proposed, many of them rely on term repetition to build links within and between documents.",
        "If there is no term repetition, there are no links.",
        "This is especially a problem when attempting to build intra-document links in shorter documents when an author may have been striving to avoid using the same word again and again and so chose a related word.",
        "We avoid this problem by using lexical chains, which collect words on the basis of their semantic similarity.",
        "Our results to date have shown promise for the methodology, and work is continuing."
