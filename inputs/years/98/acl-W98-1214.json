        "In the early stages of this research such a greedy method was used to form the clusters.",
        "However, though some clusters at the low levels of the tree seemed to be correctly formed, as the number of elements in a cluster increased towards the higher levels, the clustering results became unsatisfactory.",

        "• Shortcomings of the greedy type algorithm.",
        "• inadequacy of the method used to obtain the set behavior from the properties of its elements.",

        "Furthermore, let the distances between these words be defined as du„,,„, .",
        "Then consider the distribution in Figure 1.",

        "So the second word will be captured in the set and the algorithm will continue the clustering process with w3.",
        "At this point, though w3 is closest to w2, it is captured in a set and since w3 is closer to w4 than the center of this set is, a new cluster will be formed with members w3 and w4.",
        "However, as it can be obviously seen visually from Figure 1 the first optimal cluster to be formed between these four words is the set {w2,w3}.",
        "The second problem causing unsatisfactory clustering occurs after the initial sets are formed.",
        "According to the algorithm, the clusters behave exactly like other single words and participate in the clustering just as single words do.",
        "However to continue the process, the bigram statistics of the clusters should be determined.",
        "This means that the distance between the cluster and all the other elements in the search space have to be calculated.",
        "One easy way to determine this behavior is to find the average of the statistics of all the elements in a cluster.",
        "This method has its drawbacks.",
        "If the corpus used for the process is not large, the proximity problem becomes severe.",
        "On the other hand the linguistic role of a word may vary in contexts in different sentences.",
        "Many words are used as noun, adjective or falling into some other linguistic category depending on the context.",
        "It can be claimed that each word initially shall be placed in a cluster according to its dominant role.",
        "However to determine the behavior of a set the dominant roles of its elements should also be used.",

        "The clustering process is improved to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks.",
        "To overcome the first problem the idea used is to allow words to be members of more than one cluster.",
        "So after the first pass over the lexicon space, intersecting clusters are formed.",
        "For the lexicon space presented in Figure 1 with four words, the expected third set will be also formed.",
        "As the second step these intersecting sets are combined into a single set.",
        "Then the closest two words in each combined set (according to the distance function) are found and these two closest words are taken into consideration as the centroid for that set.",
        "After finding the centroids of all sets, the distances between a member and all the centroids are calculated for all the words in the lexicon space.",
        "Following this, each word is moved to the set where the distance between this member and the set center is minimal.",
        "This procedure is necessary since the initial sets are formed by combining the intersecting sets.",
        "When these intersecting sets are combined the set center of the resulting set might be far away from some elements and there may be other closer set centers formed by other combinations, so a reorganization of membership is appropriate.",
        "As presented in the previous section the clustering process builds up a cluster hierarchy.",
        "In the first step, words are combined to form the initial clusters, then those clusters become members of the process themselves.",
        "To combine clusters into new ones their statistical behavior should be determined.",
        "The statistical behavior of a cluster is related to the bigrams of its members.",
        "In order to find out the dominant statistical role of each cluster the notion of fuzzy membership is used.",
        "The problem that each word can belong to more than one linguistic category brings up the idea that the sets of word clusters cannot have crisp border lines and even if a word seems to be in a set due to its dominant linguistic role in the corpus, it can have a degree of membership to the other clusters in the search space.",
        "Therefore the concept of fuzzy membership can be used for determining the bigram statistics of a cluster.",
        "Researchers working on fuzzy clustering present a framework for defining fuzzy membership of elements.",
        "Gath and Geva (Gath, 1989) describe such an unsupervised optimal fuzzy clustering.",
        "They present the K-means algorithm based on minimization of an objective function.",

        "The membership func",
        "Here Xi denotes an element in the search space, Vi is the centroid of the ith cluster.",
        "K denotes the number of clusters.",
        "And d2 (Xi, Vi) is the distance of Xith element to the centroid Vi of the ith cluster.",
        "The parameter q is the weighting exponent for uii and controls the fuzziness of the resulting cluster.",
        "After the degrees of membership of all the elements of all classes in the search space are calculated, the bigram statistics of the classes are derived.",
        "To find those statistics the following method is used: For each subject cluster, the bigram statistics of each element is multiplied with its membership value.",
        "This forms the amount of statistical knowledge passed from the element to that set.",
        "So the elements chosen as set centroids will be the ones that affect a set's statistical behavior the most.",

        "Here x = {xi, x2, ..., xn} and y = {Y1, Y2, •••1 Yn} are two vectors defined over V'.",
        "Having such a metric it is possible to define the distance function between two linguistic elements.",
        "The distance function D between two words wi and W2 could be defined as follows:",
        "Here the distance function consists of two different parts D1 and D2.",
        "This is because we want the distance function to be based on both proceeding and preceding words.",
        "So the first part denotes the distance on proceeding words and the second one denotes the distance obviously on the preceding words.",
        "If we use the Manhattan metric, the distance function would be : Korkmaz and GOktiirk Clcoluk 114 Choosing A Distance Metric for Word Categorization",
        "Here n is the total number of words to be clustered, N,2 is the number of times word couple (w1, tut) is observed in the corpus and Ntu,i is the number of times word couple (wi, wi) is observed.",
        "Obviously it is the same for word tv2.",
        "This distance metric just calculates the total difference on two vector-couples obtained from the frequency matrix N, where the first couple denotes the vectors obtained by the frequencies of the word-couples formed by wi , w2 and their proceeding words.",
        "The second couple denotes the vectors formed by the frequencies with the preceding words correspondingly.",
        "The above formulation explains the structure of the distance metric used for the study.",
        "For the researched presented in our previous paper (Kork-mazkUcoluk, 1997) Manhattan Metric was the only metric used for the distance function.",
        "However others are proposed for the similarity between vectors.",
        "Another metric is the Euclidean Metric:",
        "Here x and y are again two vectors defined over W. Also the formulation of the angle between two vectors is also used for this study as a distance metric.",
        "If 0 is the angle between the two vectors x and y, then cos 9 is calculated by:",
        "Here, x'y denote the scalar product of the two vectors x and y and I x I denote the magnitude of the vector x.",
        "Since the components of the vectors in our case are corresponding to the frequencies of words, they will be non-negative.",
        "So the angle between the two vectors will be between 0° and 90°.",
        "Since cos 0° is unity and cos 90° is zero, a distance metric between the two vectors can be defined as:",
        "This distance metric will give us a number from the closed interval [0, 1], 0 denoting that the two vectors are overlapping and 1 denoting that there is an angle of 90° which is the highest difference between the vectors.",
        "The last distance metric used for the similarity function is the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient.",
        "This metric is based on the difference between the ranks of two vectors rather than the difference between their elements.",
        "The metric is defined as:",
        "For the process of formulating the distance between linguistic elements, the main problem appears due to the difference between the frequencies of words from the same linguistic category.",
        "For instance the word go has a very high frequency in natural language corpora compared to many other verbs, but still we have to cluster go with low frequency verbs.",
        "However if we use a distance metric based on only the absolute differences of vectors like the Euclidean Metric or Manhattan Metric, the distance calculated between high frequency and low frequency words would be high, which is undesired.",
        "Therefore when comparing a high frequency word with a low frequency one, we should be able to determine if the difference is caused by some regular magnitude difference.",
        "A similarity can exist between the corresponding values when this magnitude difference is discarded.",
        "Without having a distance function that compensates for this, it is not possible to overcome the errors introduced by having different frequencies for words from the same linguistic category.",
        "This acts as a considerable factor disturbing the quality of formed clusters.",
        "Having this in mind the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient Metric and the Angle Metric are used as distance function.",
        "These two seem to discard the magnitude difference between the components of the vectors.",
        "Such a comparison seems to be more suitable for evaluating the similarity of linguistic elements.",
        "In the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient the vectors are normalized into the closed interval [0, 1].",
        "So the vectors are similar if the change from one component to the next is similar, regardless of the difference in the absolute values.",
        "We have a similar comparison for the Angle Metric.",
        "When this metric Korktnaz and Getktiirk (Icoluk 115 Choosing A Distance Metric for Word Categorization is used, the length of the two vectors compared may be totally different which reflects a fact of having totally different frequencies in natural language corpora.",
        "Regardless of the magnitude of the vectors, if the angle between the two vectors is small, they will be considered similar.",
        "However the improvement obtained using these two metrics has not been so significant.",
        "It is believed that the two approaches, that is, comparing the bigram statistics absolutely and making somewhat a relative comparison between them are both effective in fetching out different aspects that lead to similarity between linguistic elements.",
        "Therefore, using just one of the approaches is not sufficient to increase the quality of formed clusters.",
        "Trying to combine these two approaches has lead to the fifth distance metric which is the combination of the Angle Metric and the Euclidean Metric.",

        "Multiplying this Euclidean distance by (1 – cos 9) has a following affect.",
        "If the angle between the vectors is small, meaning that the vectors are relatively similar, the result of the first part of the formulation will be close to zero.",
        "This will be a factor decreasing the value coming from the Euclidean distance.",
        "So even if the words have different frequencies in the corpora, their relative similarity will be a factor decreasing the absolute distance between them.",
