        "Investigations within the generative perspective aim at modelling, by means of a small number of rules, principles and constraints, linguistic phenomena (either morphological, syntactic or semantic) at a high level of abstraction, level which seems to be appropriate for research on multi-linguism and language learning.",
        "These works, among other things, attempt at modelling a certain form of 'creativity' in language: from a limited number of linguistic resources, a potentially infinite set of surface forms can be generated.",
        "Among works within the generative perspective, let us concentrate on the Generative Lexicon (Puste-jovsky 91, 95), which has settled in the past years one of the most innovative perspective in lexical semantics.",
        "This approach introduces an abstract model radically opposed to 'flat' sense enumeration lexicons.",
        "This approach, which is now well-known, is based (1) on the close cooperation of three lexical semantic structures: the argument structure (including selectional restrictions), the aspectual structure and the Qualia structure, (2) on a detailed type theory and a type coercion procedure and (3) on a refined theory of compositionality.",
        "The Generative Lexicon (GL) investigates the problem of the multiplicity of usages of a sense of a lexeme and shows how these usages can be analyzed in terms of possible type shiftings w.r.t.",
        "the type expected by a usage of that sense defined as the core usage.",
        "Type shifting is modelled by a specific inference mechanism: type coercion.",
        "The GL shows very clearly the interdependence between arguments and predicates.",
        "In our perspective, we are not only interested in deciding whether an expression is an acceptable argument for a predicate and for what reasons as it is also the case in the GL, but we want to be able to 'reconstruct' or infer the meaning of the proposition from its parts (the predicate and its arguments), and possibly also from the implicit semantics conveyed by the syntactic form (Goldberg 94).",
        "We assume that the impossibility of building a semantic representation for a proposition entails that it is semantically ill-formed w.r.t.",
        "our grammar, lexicon and composition rules.",
        "The work presented here is not definitive, it is a feasability study which aims at opening new perspectives and new treatments for the GL, while remaining in the same spirit.",
        "We will in particular show that in some cases, the Qualia structure can be combined with, or replaced by, a set of relatively general rules, which, in addition, better capture the relations between the predicator and the predicated elements.",
        "In this paper, we contrast a rule-based approach (also used by other authors such as (Copestake and Briscoe 95), (Ostler and Atkins 92), (Numberg and Zaenen 79) with different perspectives) with the Qualia-based approach and comment on their respective advantages.",
        "We show how, in fact, they can cooperate.",
        "Another view is that presented in (Jack-endoff 97, chapter 2) with his principle of enriched composition, which is in fact quite close to our view, but restricted to a few coercion situations (aspec-tual, mass-count, picture, begin-enjoy).",
        "As will be seen, these systems are not incompatible, they cover different forms of knowledge and may be useful in different situations.",
        "The rules we present here are not lexical rules, as in (Copestake and Biscoe 95), but they are part of the semantic composition sys",
        "tem.",
        "Compared to the Qualia system (Pustejovsky 91, 95), the different senses which can be derived from a more central sense are constructed in our system in context i.e. when dealing with arguments, not a priori as in the Qualia roles.",
        "Finally, in the last section of this document, we show that some problems advocated by (Copestake and Briscoe 95) concerning unification can be resolved by a constraint-based approach.",
        "Before going on into more details about our approach, here are some general comments about lexical semantics generative systems.",
        "In a lexical semantics generative system, it is of much importance to have a clear analysis of the notions of word-sense and of sense delimitation.",
        "Indeed, depending on the strategy adopted (e.g. narrow senses as in WordNet, or very large ones as in many Al works), the nature and the scope of generative operations, and therefore the philosophy of language behind these operations, may entail very different sense delimitation strategies.",
        "We do not think that it is possible to define a real theory of sense delimitation, but it is certainly possible to define a few principles or a strategy.",
        "Then, given a strategy for sense delimitation, we can adjust the complexity and the scope of generative operations.",
        "We assume that a verb potentially contains a number of subsenses which are 'triggered' by semantic composition rules depending on the arguments found in a sentence.",
        "There are several possibilities to represent a sense and its relations with subsenses, our approach is, as shall be seen below, to develop underspecified Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) (Jack-endoff 91) representations, that will also be used as a basis for developping generative mechanisms, It should be noted that, apart from fixed forms, sub-senses share quite a lot of features and are often distinguished by a few features.",
        "As shown in (Pustejovslcy 95) and (Copestake and Briscoe 95), type coercion does not occur within the verb, but at the level of the proposition, allowing a sentence such as: Mary enjoys the film and eating ice-cream.",
        "This type of sentence is problematic for unification because the verb must bear two types for the first object, syntactically an NP and a proposition (S-bar) and semantically a physical object and an event.",
        "A constraint-based approach which allows domains to be assigned to variables (the variable representing the semantics/syntax of the object) would be a good solution (see section 6).",
        "In spite of evidence of its existence (explored in the Euronet project, the European WordNet), the Qualia structure turns out to be quite difficult to describe.",
        "It is well-designed for nouns, and looks more artificial for other lexical categories, but it is in fact essentially useful for predicated elements, mostly nouns.",
        "In fact, it seems that Qualia structures are not really motivated and relevant for predicators.",
        "This can be noted in a concrete way when looking at verb Qualias which do not turn out to be very satisfactory and expressive, but rather look a little bit artificial.",
        "The descriptions made in roles are also often more pragmatic than semantic, and this may entail additional confusions in resolving type mismatches.",
        "This is in fact clearly stated in various analysis of the Aristotelician AITIAs, from which the Qualia roles emerged (Moravcsik 75), where the author shows that there is a kind of continuum between telic and agentive roles.",
        "Finally, the formal and constitutive roles are also somewhat redundant with the part-of and isa relations used to structure lexicons (or similar relations used in thesauri), it may not therefore be totally necessary to include them in the Qualia.",
        "A close observation of linguistic data and of sense variations shows that the most important role is the telic role.",
        "It is in fact the role to be considered as a default role for the coercion object 4 event.",
        "The formal role is far less frequently considered.",
        "We also think that this role should not only describe the coming into being of entities but also their destruction, which cannot enter into the telic role.",
        "We do not thing that generativity can only be based on an elaborated theory of types, and on the operation of type coercion.",
        "This operation is very powerful, simple and works satisfactorily for a number of cases, but it turns out in some cases to be insufficient and also to largely overgenerate (in particular it is quite difficult to use in natural language generation systems), unless a very rich and refined theory of type is defined, which may be contrary to the type philosophy.",
        "We think that the type system is well-designed to detect derived usages, characterizable by a type mismatch.",
        "The generality and genericity of the type coercion operation should however be kept because, via the reference to quite general types, it preserves a good degree of generality and systematicity to type shiftings.",
        "However, we feel that types are not sufficiently 'constrained' to account for the constraints holding, for each verb, on the different sense/usage variations it may be subject to.",
        "For example, an underspecified LCS form could be more appropriate because of its ability to partially represent meaning.",
        "The Qualia structure cannot encode all these constraints, in particular first because they are better designed for arguments than for predicators and second because some con-Saint-Dizier 122 Sense Variation and Lexical Semantics straints are relational between the predicator and the argument, which the roles cannot describe.",
        "In this document, we first present a standard classification of the different forms of relations between a predicate and its arguments, then we outline some considerations on the difficult problem of sense charaterization and delimitation.",
        "We then show how it is possible to give up the principle of a Qualia structure and, in some cases, of type coercion in favor of (1) other sources of knowledge, essentially inherent properties of lexical items and (2) simple inference rules.",
        "This approach may be felt to somewhat resemble meaning postulates, but it is organized on a larger scale and treats different phenomena."

      "text": [
        "In this section, we consider the different types of usage relations between an argument and a predicate as introduced in the GL, and add some distinctions.",
        "By usage relation, we mean the analysis of the concordance/matching relation between a predicative term and one of its arguments in a language utterance.",
        "These relations are well-known and are discussed within our framework in (Mari 97) and (Mari and Saint-Dizier 97).",
        "The relational perspective adopted here is mathematically richer than a functional one, it allows us to introduce ambiguity and non-determinism.",
        "It also gives an equal role to the predicate and to the argument (this is also the case in the GL).",
        "The typology of usage will then serve as a basis for an analysis of sense delimitation and for the devel-opement of generative operations.",
        "We consider here • the following forms of usage relations, which are, for most of them, very classical:",
        "• Selection: the type of the argument is subsumed by the type (possibly polymorphic or 'dotted') expected by the predicate for that argument.",
        "In general, the sense conveyed by the verb, which may be largely underspecified, is made more precise by the type of the argument by means of more or less complex compositional rules.",
        "For example, for the verb construire (construct), the expected object is, for example, of type 'physical-object V abstract-construction'.",
        "Selection is also called selective binding in the GL.",
        "Selection is clearly a wider phenomenon for general purpose (generic) verbs than for verbs with a more restricted meaning.",
        "Within our approach, instead of just using types, the different subsenses of a verb are represented by means of underspecified LCS forms.",
        "The possible/potential instanciations are described by means of a system of constraints and LCS forms: Constraint : L CS form used to fill in under-specied positions.",
        "This is exemplified in sections 4 and 5.",
        "• Metonymy: in an argument, an entity is used to refer to another one, via lexical relations, among which mainly the part-whole relation (and its different forms (Winston et al.",
        "87)), but also forms such as producer-product or institution-person relations.",
        "A number of metonymies have a high degree of systematicity in language (Lakoff 80), possibly over different languages.",
        "There are well-known examples of metonymies such as buses are on strike today (object for user or controller) or I bought a Ford (make for object).",
        "Most of these forms are treated by the GL via the constitutive or formal roles, but in a rather unconstrained way (except",
        "for the constraints implicit in the Qualia).",
        "We can somewhat structure metonymies by considering 3 major forms: – metonymies based on the part-of relation, – metonymies based on various forms of argument type shiftings such as the make for object illustrated above (I bought a Ford/ a Sun).",
        "There is always a semantic link such as possession between the expected and the realized arguments.",
        "Another link is, e.g. physical object -+ monetary value.",
        "An interesting case is a sentence such as I bought French to express that I bought some product made in France or whose make is known to be French.",
        " – metonymies introducing an emphasis on properties of the argument related to actions and to its uses.",
        "From the argument's properties, argument type shiftings (also called alternations) can be defined such as the alternation physical object event.",
        "The famous ambiguous example of the GL: 'begin a book' is treated by this type of metonymy, using the general rule that any physical object was once created and can be used in a number of ways.",
        "Metonymies will not be developed in this paper.",
        "• Metaphor: this phenomenon is more complex and diverse than metonymy.",
        "It is however possible to isolate several types of metaphors which are relatively concrete, and which also",
        "Saint-Dizier 123 Sense Variation and Lexical Semantics have a good degree of systematicity.",
        "These metaphors refer usually to partial homornor-phisms between ontologies of different conceptual domains, with a focus on some aspects (or semes) carried prominently by the argument.",
        "General schemas have been defined, e.g. in (Lakoff 80), such as: Ideas are objects, ideas are food, creation is birth, activity is a substance, etc.",
        "which can, roughly speaking and within the GL perspective, allow a type to be changed into another.",
        "Metaphors are not, in general, treated by the GL, at least in a simple way.",
        "Rules for metaphors are based on type shiftings; their scope must undoubtly be restricted to some groups of nouns.",
        "The semantic interpretation of a metaphorical expression is in general not a trivial matter and much remains to be done in this area.",
        "• Co-composition deals with the emergence of",
        "unexpected new senses, often with an important sense variation, from the combination of an argument with a predicate.",
        "This phenomenon usually goes somewhat beyond compositionality and may be at the origin of semi-fixed or fixed forms.",
        "Compared to the definition given in (Pustejovsky 91), we have a more restricted view of co-composition.",
        "In our view, co-composition occurs when there is an important change in meaning, not simply when an argument has influence over the verb's semantics.",
        "We do not think, in fact, that an argument may modify the meaning of a verb, it can just specialize it, but this specialization remains compositional.",
        "Situations of co-composition occur when the meaning of a proposition is not jut a certain composition of the meaning of its parts, but something different.",
        "Examples abound of this phenomena, such as: produire des temoins, se payer un zero, gagner sa vie.",
        "Co-composition is particularly difficult to analyze.",
        "Let us note two points.",
        "First, in a number of co-composition relations, a few, usually secondary, features are strongly highlighted, producing the feeling of 'unexpected' use.",
        "Secondly, these forms are not formed at random and do not acquire a meaning also at random.",
        "Some of them may be the remnants of productive forms, perfectly compositional, several centuries ago.",
        "Fixed forms may then be considered as an impoverishment of previously compositional forms (see (Mari 97) for a few notes).",
        "Althought we haven't studied very far co-composition, we believe that a simple way to handle a number of them is to establish a link with one of its paraphrases, whenever possible, which involves a more regular form of composition.",
        "For example, se payer un zero will be associated with a verb (in English) such as to get and more precisely to get a zero.",
        "Similarly, se composer un visage = to compose one's face (section 5.1) will be associated with the expression to hide one's feelings or opinions.",
        "These types of variations are claimed (e.g. in (Lakoff 80)) to have a quite good degree of systematicity among verbs.",
        "It is important for our model to evaluate how stable they are within and over verb semantic classes in order to attain a certain generality and reusability."

        "Sense delimitation is a very delicate, but crucial, problem.",
        "It has been studied at length by many authors and in many projects.",
        "Let us say very informally that, in our perspective, we assume that a sense (more or less large and constrained) of a lexeme has a basic form and basic expressions called usage(s) (a surface form reflecting the basic sense).",
        "For example, let us assume that for the verb devour, its basic sense has a human or animal as subject and an edible object as its object.",
        "Then John devours meat is a basic usage.",
        "The basic sense expects some types of arguments but it may also originate derived usages (via the above generative operations), which are more or less constrained and limited.",
        "For the above example, we have John devours books, which is metaphorical.",
        "Since we can only observe linguistic realizations of these derived usages, sense delimitation is then defining sets of usages sharing the same semantic 'root', and identifying that root.",
        "Meaning is then assigned to linguistic expressions from the meaning of their constituents and by taking into account the semantic shifts introduced by the generative operations involved.",
        "This perspective may be felt to be somewhat naive and archaic: (1) examples abound where it is not possible to identify a root among usages, and (2) usages are not necessarily derived from a more or less unique root but may result from complex interactions among derived usages.",
        "Nevertheless, we can say that:",
        "• our perspective is workable for utterances from relatively standard texts.",
        "It is of course always possible to find counter-examples, but Saint-Dizier 124 Sense Variation and Lexical Semantics then their rate of occurence should be evaluated.",
        "• We have at our disposal formal and practical tools to 'soften' the notion of semantic root, e.g. polymorphic types, or complex systems for semantic representations.",
        "• Our approach is incremental, allowing the ad-junction, step by step, of new usages.",
        "• Semi-fixed forms and fixed forms are treated apart, and we believe that a number of counterexamples to our approach could fall in this class.",
        "Sense delimitation is largely an open problem.",
        "It is indeed almost impossible to state precise and general principles that characterize the boundaries of different senses of a lexeme and what a sense exactly is.",
        "To make our approach workable, let us assume that senses exist independently of linguistic realizations, whatever they are called (e.g. concepts), and that it is possible to formally represent them.",
        "Sense delimitation largely depends on the theoretical and practical perspectives and, to a large extent, on intuition.",
        "The difficulty is then to elaborate a coherent system of sense delimitation and of sense/usage variation.",
        "Extreme solutions have been proposed, which are not totally satisfactory.",
        "For example WordNet (Fellbaum 93) tends to introduce one sense per usage, where a usage is characterized by the semantic features of the arguments.",
        "For example, WordNet has 27 different senses for the verb give.",
        "Distinctions between senses are often very subtle and somewhat hard to represent in a formal semantic representation.",
        "This approach is very useful in the sense that it provides a very detailed description of the usages of a large number of words in English, but we think it lacks generalizations about language which are often useful for NLP systems to work efficiently.",
        "On the other extreme, there are Al systems which tend to postulate a unique sense for a lexeme and very complex derivation procedures, involving complex logical systems, to produce different sub-senses.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that most Al approaches are not concerned with usages in language but just by meaning representation.",
        "Our perspective is in-between these extremes.",
        "We think that the different usages of a word should be organized around a small, relatively generic, number of senses.",
        "From these senses, similarly to the GL, generative procedures should produce or recognize derived usages, with possible slight changes in meaning.",
        "Sense delimitation is addressed more formally in (Saint-Dizier 98).",
        "A second problem is the definition of the nature and the form of constraints related to sense delimitation.",
        "For example, there are meaning components within a given sense which can be more or less constrained or opened.",
        "Within a given sense, modalities, which are often more peripheral, such as: manner, means, goals, existence of an effect or telicity may be left unconstrained whereas elements such as the type of agent, the existence of a cause, or the type of the first object (e.g. physical object or not, as in vendre un objet = to sell versus vendre quelqu'un = to denounce) may be much more constrained.",
        "Then, given a set of usages assumed to be related to a unique sense, on what basis should the basic usage(s) and, therefore, sense be defined ?",
        "We will show that it is often the most usual usage which is the most primitive, probably the most concrete one, often one of the most widely used, and also possibly historically and ontogenetically the oldest (Mari 97).",

Dorr's work on LCS forms for verb classes in English).",
