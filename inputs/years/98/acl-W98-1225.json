        "In most mainstream approaches to natural language modelling and parsing, some form of hierarchical structure plays a central role.",
        "The most obvious case in point is phrase structure.",
        "However, while the latter notion has shown its theoretical relevance in many ways, practical applications based on phrase structure description are not without problems.",
        "The main reason for this is the high flexibility of natural language.",
        "In performance data (i.e. actual language use), many disruptions of, and variations on standard phrase structure patterns occur.",
        "As a result, application of phrase structure-based parsers in natural language processing shows only limited success.",
        "This has inspired a search for alternative methods, such as statistical based or lexicon-driven parsing.",
        "In our search for a solution to the problems mentioned we decided to take one step back, and examine the underlying nature of hierarchical structure in general, and phrase structure in particular.",
        "Our aim in doing so was to find a more principled solution to the problems of linguistic analysis and parsing.",
        "We looked for ways to derive structural information from input, and to incorporate this in a mathematically well-founded theory of knowledge representation.",
        "As a result we found a level of abstractness that, in principle, allows language-independent modelling and analysis.",
        "In our approach we capitalise on the property that the information carriers, the lexical items, are 'willing' to combine.",
        "These combinatorial properties are determined by inherent characteristics of lexical items.",
        "Hierarchical structure follows naturally from the interaction of these properties, while leaving room for variation and flexibility in structural patterning.",
        "In our model of natural language (NL) the input is represented as a binary relation.",
        "This is due to the dichotomy of language, meaning that a classification of lexical items as objects and attributes can be made (we use the term \"dichotomy\" in a restricted sense: a division into two mutually exclusive parts).",
        "The two classes are interrelated, and their relation can be determined merely on the basis of lexical information and some general principles, like word order (e.g. SVO).",
        "The relation between the classes is due to the principle of relatedness.",
        "This principle entails that any non-empty set of objects implies the existence of a non-empty set of attributes (properties) it is related to, and vice versa.",
        "Minimally, an observable entity (object) has the property of existence (attribute).",
        "This principle gives rise to a relation representing the semantics of the 'thought' described by the sentence in terms of a set of related items, called observations.",
        "An observation captures a set of objects and properties that are mutually characteristic of each other.",
        "Such a notion corresponds to a formal concept in lattice theory.",
        "We will show that the above relation is supported by linguistic considerations.",

        "Functor-argument relations, the manifestations of the (combinatorial) properties of lexical item's, have various realizations on the linguistic level.",
        "For example, the verb – complement relation is not the same as the relation of modification.",
        "This becomes clear when we look at the optionality of modifiers.",
        "In English, we cannot say, on the basis of encountering a noun, that it needs an adjectival modifier; however, when we encounter an adjective, we do know that at some level it needs a noun because it is a semantic predicate (functor) taking an argument of which it is predicated.",
        "In this case, then, there is an asymmetrical relation between functor and argument.",
        "On the other hand, the relation between a verb and its complementation is a symmetrical one.",

        "These types of relations can be recursively nested, and their sum uniquely characterises the input.",
        "The first type of relation, the major relation, or predication, is a pair (p, a), where a functions as an argument to the predicate p. A major relation may involve the distinction between an action/state and its participants (symmetrical relation: each requires the presence of the other) and between an action/state or participant on the one hand and its properties on the other (asymmetrical relation, or modification: the predicate requires the argument of which it is predicated, but the reverse does not hold).",
        "We call predicates of the first type major predicates, and predicates of the second type minor predicates.",
        "It is interesting to note that this distinction reflects the difference between constituency on the one hand, and dependency on the other.",
        "In linguistics, these two relations are often treated as (formally) equivalent alternatives.'",
        "In the current view, they entail a difference in status of the units that are involved in the relation.",
        "The nature of the relation in both cases is that of predication; however, in the 'However, see (Fraser, 1996) for some qualifying remarks on this topic.",
        "constituency case each part assumes the presence of the other, whereas in the dependency case, the predicate is optional.",
        "There are various distinguishing factors between major and minor predicates.",
        "In English, major predicates (usually) relate to the noun-verb division; minor predicates do not.",
        "Major predicates are typically realized by verbs; minor predicates by adjectives and adverbs.",
        "There is never more than one major predicate associated with an argument; there may be several minor predicates related to the same argument.",
        "(This reflects the possibility of having zero or more modifiers of an action or participant.)",
        "Both major and minor predicates can provide semantic roles, but major predicates introduce participant roles for their arguments; minor predicates can introduce additional roles (such as location or manner) or properties of their arguments.",
        "The second type of relation, the minor relation, or qualification, distinguishes between the core content of a linguistic expression and some qualification of it.",
        "At the level of an action and its participants, for example, this qualification may relate to referential status of NPs (e.g. definite vs. indefinite article), or to tense and aspect information at clause level.",
        "Intensifying adverbs (e.g. very, extremely, deeply) and comparative adverbs (e.g. more and most) also belong to the class of qualifiers.",

        "However, this is still an object of further study.",
        "In this paper we will restrict ourselves to the distinction between qualifier and core in general.",
        "The difference between a minor predicate and a qualifier is that the latter does not introduce a meaning that is independent of the element it qualifies.",
        "The presence of a qualifier of a specific type, therefore, also signals the presence of its counterpart.",
        "Furthermore, there can be several modifiers associated with an argument or predicate; typically, however, there will only be a single (possibly composite) qualifier.",
        "In the case of referential information, for instance, the qualifier situates the argument or predicate in its referential context of which there will only be one.",
        "In some cases different aspects of the 2By contrast, a minor predicate has some aspect of meaning that is independent of the element it combines with.",
        "This is illustrated by the fact that minor predicates can be used in different contexts.",
        "For example, a prepositional phrase can modify an argument (e.g. noun) but also a predicate (e.g. verb).",
        "An adjective phrase can be used as a modifier of a noun, but also in the complementation of a verb qualifier can be expressed separately (such as tense and aspect); in that case these different aspects must be unifiable but there cannot be more than a single qualifier relating to the same domain.",
        "The qualifier evokes its counterpart; nevertheless, the semantic 'core' is also complete in itself, in that it forms a full account of semantic relationships.",
        "Therefore it does not require realization of the qualifier as such: cf. the use of such bare relations in captions or telegram style speech (e.g. \"Lion attacked woman!\").",
        "Summing up, we distinguish between the following relations:",
        "• major predication • minor predication • qualification.",
        "A schematic representation of these possibilities is given in Fig. 1.",
        "It is important to note that this diagram does not represent the hierarchical structure of sentences, or the organisation of conceptual content within the sentence (we will come back to this below); it merely shows the different types of relations that our approach identifies.",
        "These relations lie at the heart of structure formation in NL.",
        "How phrase structure emerges as a result of their interaction is explained in Sect.",
        "6.",
        "As mentioned, the different relations can be recursively nested.",
        "For example, at the level of argument, a modifying predicate may be added in the form of an adjective phrase, or a qualifier may be present in the form of a determiner.",
        "Each element that is added stands in a certain relation to its counterpart, based on the type of relation that was applied.",
        "There is a potential mapping between the linguistic relations displayed in Fig. 1 and the hierarchical organisation of information structure.",
        "For example, it is likely that the major predication relation is the most important information carrier with respect to the semantic content of the sentence, and that the minor predication relation reflects additional information of less importance.",
        "This illustrates the relative contribution of the different linguistic relations to information content.",
        "In information retrieval this could help to generate a concise representation of retrieved text.",
        "It would also be in line with the use, already mentioned, of the major predication relation in captions or telegram style speech; furthermore, it could be a possible explanation for the ability of speed-reading that readers may develop.",
        "The qualification gives concrete reference to all the items involved in the predication relation, and as such is relevant for all levels.",
        "The presence of the qualifier at all levels of representation is a matter of some importance: word order, for instance, may also be classified as past of the qualification relation (e.g. in English, word order is relevant for identifying questions, and also in assigning thematic roles to participants).",
        "The relationship between qualifiers in NLCA, and operators in the semantically based hierarchy of Role and Reference Grammar (Van Valin, 1993) would be a potentially useful area to investigate."

        "In the dyadic model of FCA, a context allows only two kinds of entities: object and attribute.",
        "Therefore, each lexical item has to be classified as one these, based on its lexical type.",
        "Typical objects are nouns; typical attributes are verbs (major predicates), and adjectives and adverbs (minor predicates).",
        "We refer to these attributes uniformly as major attributes (involving predication).",
        "Qualifiers are classified as attributes, as well.",
        "We call them minor attributes (involving qualification).",
        "A comment with respect to the classification of lexical items and its relation to Peirce's universal categories is in place.",
        "We mentioned that objects and attributes formalise the categories firstness and secondness.",
        "Each item of these classes may evoke a different relation (called interpretant) depending on the item's syntactic and semantic properties, and in general, the properties of the item as a sign (Liszka., 1996).",
        "In NLCA these interpretants are instantiations of the linguistic relations formalising the category of thirdness.",
        "For example, the interpretant created by a verb, an instance of a major predication, may 'explain' how that verb binds its arguments together \"in a bundle of interlocking relation-ships\" (Sowa, 1996).",
        "The surjective mapping from lexical types to the sets of the dyadic model can be defined without causing confusion.",
        "The set of lexical types defines a partition of L, the set of lexical items and semantic roles involved in the analysis, which is further partitioned according to the dyadic model, yielding the sets G and M. From G C L and M C L follows that there is an embedding of the relation R C GxM in Lx L. This means that any pair (g, m) E R can be defined as the unique yield of l and 12 (6.32 E L) by the assignments l 1-4 g and 12 in, where 1-3 respects the mapping of lexical types.",
        "As said above, each lexical item is classified according to its type.",

        "We say the input is well-formed if the combinatorial demands of each lexical item are satisfied.",

        "For each domain holds that when an argument position is filled by more than a single element, these different elements have to be compatible (possibly depending on the context).",
        "For example, with multiple modifiers, e.g. two or more adjectives modifying a noun, the modifiers have to be semantically compatible in order to make a sensible construct: cf. the tall happy girl vs. ?the tall short girl.",
        "The external arguments of a verb (major predicate) are determined by the verb's valency: the subject is also an external argument.",

        "Thus, when the qualifier-domain of the internal argument of both the object and the major attribute is filled, there is explicit reference with respect to the action and the participants involved.",
        "Since qualifiers contain a specific type of information, they can be regarded as a syntactic pointer to the qualified element itself: if this domain of the internal argument is filled, there must also be an object/attribute of the type that the internal argument belongs to.",

        "However, a more detailed analysis of predicates into different types (accomplishment, activity, state and achievement) with associated logical structure (as in RRG) is a desirability for the development of the NLCA-lexicon.",
        "In this example, we can see that assigning 'rose' to the object class leaves the analysis incomplete: the object is not connected to any attribute.",

        "This is in fact the case: cf. the occurrence of multiple modifiers of a single head, but also, in the current example, 'door' functioning as argument to both the article 'the' and the verb 'squeaks'.",
        "That the two have different status is not a problem and is in fact relevant: when 'door' fulfils the external argument role of a verb it is involved in the major predication, because it itself requires a verb, but when it fulfils the external argument role of adjectives or of articles it is not; it just completes their demands.",
        "There is another aspect of the model that can be illustrated on the basis of a sentence of this kind.",
        "For this purpose, let us use the sentence The moon rose.",

        "Note that this leads to a chain of PTIls from 'the' via the Proto-object to an external argument that has been filled; such a chain gives rise to inheritance of the `+' to all relations involved in it.",

        "Note that the nominal adjective phrase would not be created without the article: it is the article that supplies the Proto-object that functions in the nominal adjective phrase.",
        "It can do so because it belongs to the class of qualifiers; they require the presence of their counterpart and therefore can be said to create a Proto-object.",
        "The adjective, on the other hand, belongs to the class of modifiers that are involved in the relation of minor predication.",
        "For this reason, they can be said to have an implicit object required to fill the place of their external argument position.",

        "Second, the use of Proto-objects makes it unnecessary to have a rule defining noun phrase heads as realized either by nouns, or by numerals, quantifying pronouns, demonstrative pronouns etc.",
        "In fact, this also applies to nominal adjective phrases: there is no need to define adjectives as possible realizations of noun phrase heads.",
        "The nominal adjective phrase follows naturally from the presence of the article (creating the Proto-object) and the adjective (combining with the Proto-object).",

        "For example, the concept Cl denotes the observation: a particular ('the') object ('girl') has a property ('happy') and is the AGENT participant of the action 'buy(PosT)'.",
        "The concept C3 denotes the observation that 'girl' and 'flower(s)' are related to the action `buy(PAST)'.",
        "It is interesting that these concepts correspond to the focus of WH-questions: (Cl) Who bought (something)?",
        "(C3) What happened?",
        "This suggests a potential correspondence between the linguistic device of question-formation and the information reflected in the lattice.",
        "Moreover, it exemplifies the postulate (Sarbo, 1997) that a concept lattice is an appropriate representation for what is referred to in artificial intelligence as 'cooperative communication' (Grice, 1975).",
        "In addition to the individual concepts, a (sub)lattice also has information content, comparable to that of a clause.",
