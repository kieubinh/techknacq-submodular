Next, a new system.",

        "To be able to show our cause for concern we must look at the statistics of a well known parser, and also at its actions.",
        "Unfortunately there are relatively few systems which are freely available for consultation or examination, and for this reason we are forced to pick on some of the few systems that are.",
        "The criticisms we make here are not directed against the parsers we use as examples, but against the way in which our field is treating its statistics.",
        "Our main example is the ENGCG parser, in one specific form which has been available for several years now, and frorril which many influential variants have been spawned, including the one being used to tag the Bank of English (Voutilainen and Silvonen, 1996).",
        "Perhaps unfortunately for it, the ENGCG parser is very conveniently consulted on the Net, and statistics on it have been published.",
        "Another good reason for our examination of this parser-group is the comment made by them, above, that \"the tagger reaches a better accuracy than previous systems (over 99%).\" And the fact is that it does seem to represent the best approach currently."

        "27 of the wrong roles that had no accompanying correct role were nouns that were mis-designated as to case, but were correctly designated as nouns.",
        "We did notice that there is no special tag specifically for the objects of non-finite verbs, and that these words were designated as having the label nom (i.e. \"nominal\") as also were the objects of prepositional phrases; this caused an extra 10 responses which we regarded as unusual, but which were not counted as incorrect because they seemed to be correctly designated according to the designers' specifications.",

        "Thus, our results for the ENGCG parser on the first 1000 words of chapter three of \"Alice in Wonderland\" is that 89.2% of the words had no extra wrong roles and 96.7% of the words had a correct tag amongst their final list of roles.",
        "We have conducted a further assessment on the operation of the ENGCG parser, over the first 1000 words of Chapter four of Alice in Wonderland (Carroll, 1975); the results there were less impressive - 82.0% of words had no extra wrong roles (18.0% did), and 94.8% of words had a correct tag amongst their final list of roles (5.2% did not).",
        "Our conclusions regarding the ENGCG parser, and these figures on it, are that: 1 for what it does, it works well, and speedily too.",

        "Even with a number of occurrences of applying water, (i.e. using water as a verb), the parser will still probably show better results by omitting the possibility of it being a verb: for the most part the parser will operate \"more accurately\" from the omission, so long as the number of verb-water is fairly small.",
        "There is no verb-role given to the word water by the ENGCG parser in its response to our example-sentence (2) above (that \"non-response\" was of course correct); and the noun role given by it is correct not only for sentence (2) but perhaps for about 99% of the appearances of the word water.",

        "That enhancement could be done by omitting every alternative word-role from the starting-role list if that alternative is only seldom ever needed in the given corpus: that would cause substantial statistical enhancement of a parser's reaction-measurements on even a very large, genuinely naturally occurring, corpus.",
        "It could be argued that, because the parser then follows the main-chance reading of English, it is now actually the better parser for that.",
        "It is probably the faster parser, and it will respond with less spurious roles to many sentences, but it lacks depth in its deductions as a result; crucially in our view, that parser would have failed to tap any deep regularities of the patterns of English.",

        "This simplistic parser scored a figure of 80.7% correct on the piece of text selected - which figure, in a sense, creates a baseline or zero-level for that piece of text.",
        "This is really the way that one traditionally develops a grammar - the initial version would normally be enhanced as further iterations are made, but whilst we were tempted to rectify the obvious problems, the statistics in Table 1 for this \"obvious tagger\" has not had the benefit of any refinement.",
        "This \"grammar\" is designed to be used only for benchmarking, not as a real grammar or for a production parser.",

        "It will be noted then that the grammar's rules leave plenty of scope to reward the parser which is operating even moderately well, and that the technique can be applied to both type I and type II errors.",
        "The obvious parser is somewhat rough, but it makes the statistics offered by the measurement of correct word-roles on corpora far more meaningful as long as the baseline is set for each corpus - otherwise we are simply multiplying the error rate by 5 if we set the benchmark ceiling to (roughly) 20% rather than the more commonly assumed 100%.",
        "Certainly, this rebalancing test means that a parser is no longer given credit for just correctly applying a tag which is completely obvious anyway (for example, the tag article for the word the), but that is currently what is occurring.",
