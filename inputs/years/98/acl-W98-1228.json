        "As envisaged by Koch and successive co-authors, it is the role of the saliency map to determine the most salient input region, and to gate visual input so as to highlight this attended region for more detailed processing.",
        "In this way, selective attention is sited conceptually amongst detection of elementary features, and decoupled from more sophisticated representations computed further along the visual pathway.",
        "Yet while the selection mechanism typically isolates a salient region for high-resolution representation and processing (in part accomplished through suppression of competing stimuli), modulation may also be reflected in a relatively low-resolution representation of the entire field - highlighting the attended object at the expense of less salient ones.",
        "As the modulating signal is thought to be directed back to primary visual cortex, such reduced maps may be computed at a number of points along the visual processing hierarchy, as required by the sophistication of the relation to be represented16.",
        "While acknowledging, therefore, the importance of preprocessing as identified by (Regier, 1992), the present work does not employ feature extraction machinery of the same sophistication.",
        "In part, this may be justified by noting that much of the computational difficulty of the problem is removed once the fovea has been positioned - limiting the class of examples with which the system may be faced.",
        "Yet a more powerful justification is philosophical: the representations considered below require neither a high level of genetic determinism nor a long period of inductive learning to become established."

        "Reduced maps of this type provide a kind of probabilistic localisation – proximal objects being represented with high probability, and distal objects being represented with low (but still significant) probability.",
        "Thus, the representation is flexible within the bounds provided by foveal alignment, allowing significant fault tolerance in the boundary of each field.",
        "Computationally, the approach provides a substantial reduction of dimension, producing an encoding of the problem allowing recruitment at the output network without propagation of an error signal to the underlying representation.",

        "In this work, we have developed a powerful new architecture for modelling the acquisition of spatial semantics, providing a number of advantages over previous approaches – in particular in its potential for application to more cluttered input scenes and linguistically complex phenomena.",
        "While discussion has centred upon a system which caters for static concepts, the system is immediately extensible to the case of dynamic concepts through the addition of a temporal change map to the model input (Niebur and Koch, 1995).",
        "Representations introduced by the model are based on simple, probabilistic receptive fields encoding activation of the saliency map, and requiring limited prior knowledge and learning to be realised – having also substantial advantages in fault tolerance.",
        "In forthcoming work we shall present results for system learning from a wide range of static and dynamic concepts and examine extensions of the model to include linguistic description of faces based upon the spatial relationship between constituent features (for example, the shape and relative positions of nose, mouth and eyes)."
