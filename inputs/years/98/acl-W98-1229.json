        "Machine acquisition of natural language is one of the most challenging targets of cognitive science.",
        "As a basis for language acquisition, we deal with acquisition of a symbol system, which articulates things and events in the world into categories and gives phonological labels to the categories.",
        "The relationships between the categories and labels are arbitrary conventions shared by people, so that infants have to learn them through interaction with people.",
        "This paper describes the role of \"attention-sharing\" (Baron-Cohen, 1995), especially that based on gaze, in infants' symbol acquisition.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates how attention-sharing is achieved: self (S) captures gaze-direction of an agent (A), then the self searches in the direction and identifies the target (T).",
        "Shared attention spotlights things and events being mentioned and makes the communication coherent about the same target."

        "Observation of others' verbal behavior provides infants with learning data for symbol acquisition.",
        "Let us consider that an agent, looking at a cat, says \"cat\", as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In order to mimic this verbal behavior, the self has to observe the",
        "agent's sensory-input I (stimulus from the cat) and motor-output 0 (verbal response) and to make the association between them.",
        "Attention-sharing enables us to observe someone else's input and output, as also shown in Figure 2.",
        "Attention-sharing guarantees that I' (the self's input) resembles I, since both are paying attention to the same target.",
        "At the gaze-capturing stage (Figure 1, left), the self can observe the agent's output 0 and map it onto the self's motor image 0'.",
        "(We assume an innate mapping mechanism like imitation of facial gestures by neonates.)",
        "Although thus observed relationships between input space and output space may vary in many ways (size, color, tone, volume, etc.",
        "), one can construct an efficient mediator between these spaces.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 3, the complex relationships (left)",
        "can be decomposed into several (almost separated) components by introducing a hidden mediator space M (right), on which \"symbols\" can emerge."

        "Also in some non-human primates show attention-sharing (Itakura, 1996).",
        "Most of infants and children with autism do not show attention-sharing; being instructed by an experimenter, however, they can do it (Baron-Cohen, 1995).",
        "This means they are unaware that one's gaze-direction implies his or her attentional target.",
        "Being unaware of others' attention, children with autism show typical disorders in verbal and nonverbal communication (Frith, 1989).",
        "Most of children with autism can not acquire language or use language properly.",
        "This is because (1) they failed in observing verbal (and also pragmatic) behavior of others, and (2) they failed in observing positive/ negative feedback for elaborating their hypothetic language models."

        "The gaze-monitoring process consists of the following tasks, as also shown in Figure 5: (1) detect a face in a scene, (2) saccade to the face and switch to the zoom cameras, (3) detect eyes and determine the gaze-direction in terms of the position of the pupils, and (4) search for an object in the direction.",

        "The model will work in the bootstrapping stage of infants' symbol acquisition; it only deals with referring to physical objects.",
        "Infants at this stage tend to take an unknown label as a category name of a physical object, and then apply the label to other objects with similar shape (Imai, 1997).",
        "In future research, we have to fully implement the gaze-monitoring process and to evaluate it in human-robot interaction.",
