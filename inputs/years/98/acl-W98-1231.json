        "It is not always evident what level of analysis should be involved.",
        "For instance, whether a certain task requires a full parse or whether some 'shallow' operations may be sufficient is often difficult to determine.",
        "The choice of tools can be guided by the data or the requirements and the prerequisites of the goal to be reached.",
        "These considerations may depend on the availability of a grammatical model, the required standard of the results, and processing time constraints.",
        "However, the optimization of this task remains an unresolved area until now.",
        "The interest of the NLP community for 'shallow' processing has grown recently (cf. (Karlsson, 1990),(Abney, 1996), (Declerck and Klein, 1997)).",

        "Grammatically erroneous sentences are detected by a set of rules describing common weak points such as missing punctuation marks or ill-formed agreement.",
        "• Style checking",
        "Highly complex constructions or heavy phrases can disturb the reading and understanding process.",
        "To avoid this, style checkers can recognize such patterns so that the author can readjust his text for better communication.",
        "• Shallow parsing",
        "Shallow parsing can help to simplify the data before full parsing is undertaken.",
        "It recognizes syntactic phrases, mostly on the nominal level.",

        "The morphological analysis deals with words which are presented in texts.",
        "High level processing deals with units between the word level and the text level, mostly with sentences.",
        "Thus, sentence segmentation is a typical shallow process, but other subunits could be equally interesting.",
        "The basic idea of the presented formalism is the following: in a set of rules, patterns are defined which are mapped onto the morphologically analyzed input strings.",
        "If the mapping is successful, modifications of the analysis are undertaken according to the specifications in the rule.",
