        "Alan Turing was a brilliant British mathematician who played an important role in the development of computers and developed a test that would serve as an indicator of intelligence for machines.",
        "A lot of researchers posed the Loebner Prize as the first formal instantiation of the Turing Test.",
        "To participate in this competition, we conceived a program that attempts to simulate the responses of a human being.",
        "We'll begin to describe WordNet, which includes a classification of English words.",
        "Afterwards, we'll present the architecture of our system which we are programming at the moment.",
        "In this section, we'll briefly explain every module.",
        "Next, we'll give an example of interaction between our program and one human.",
        "In the same section, we'll show different processes of generating a response from the input of the user.",
        "Finally, we'll conclude by indicating our own position on this test, using knowledge that we have acquired during only two months of work in this area."

        "WordNet is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistics theories of human lexical memory.",
        "Actually, WordNet contains about 170,000 words, classified according to their part-of-speech (verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs).",
        "These sets are divided into semanticals categories (e.g. synonymous for nouns...).",

      "text": [
        "For spelling correction, we initially chose to create a prolog database, holding all words present in WordNet, indexed on every character, and reduce the sets of possible words at the time of typing.",
        "If we obtain an empty set, we can use a parallel process to search for every possible word, and await the end of typing to choose the most likely word using trigrams.",
        "Another way is to build a database taking every word and the most common typing errors of this word.",
        "To determinate the most common errors, we can read training data from news, where many errors occur.",
