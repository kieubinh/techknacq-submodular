        "The method presented in this paper is inspired by the distributional approach developed by American structuralists between 1940 and 1950 (Harris, 1951).",
        "This approach is characterized by two facts: (a) the use of corpora and (b) the use of the notion of distribution instead of the sense of elements.",
        "The distribution of an element is the set of the environments in which the element occurs.",
        "Other works describe systems that induce structures from corpora, but they use tagged corpora (Brill, 1993), or grammatical informations (Brent, 1993), or work with artificial samples (Ehnan, 1990).",
        "Our originality lies in the fact that we only use untagged and non artificial corpora without specific knowledge about the studied language.",
        "We try to discover the structures of a natural language from raw texts of this language (on 100,000 words).",
        "We show that this kind of discovery is possible if we have some expectations of the structure of Natural Languages and if we use some formal properties.",
        "The method relies on structural linguistic concepts: the morpheme, the chunk and the linearity of the language, i.e. the corpus is composed of a unidimensional sequence of elements.",
        "We first give here an overview of the concepts and general principles, from morphemes to syntactic structures discovery.",
        "Then we explain in detail how the segmentation is carried out."

        "Natural Languages are a linear object.",
        "It means that sentences are sequences of sounds.",
        "In the case of written sentences, we consider them as sequences of letters (or characters).",
        "We also consider that languages are not only sequences of sound but are structured in several structural levels.",
        "We claim that these different levels are formally indicated in the sentences.",
        "How?",
        "Since sentences are unidimensional object, a simple way is the use of boundaries indicators between the elements which composed the sentences.",
        "Applying this principle on several Languages, we find out three multilingual and hierarchical levels: the morpheme level, the chunk level and the clause level.",
        "One useful formal criterium in the discovery of these structures is the position of words and morphemes relatively to beginnings and ends of sentences.",
        "The morpheme level is already well known in Linguistics.",
        "The morphemes are the basic elements of the structure.",
        "In this paper, we call morphemes the affixes of the language.",
        "These elements are discovered during the operation of words segmentation.",
        "The morphemes contain as much structural informations as grammatical words and are essential to the discovery of the syntactic structures.",
        "Section 3 explains how we list them.",
        "The higher level is the chunk one.",

        "NeMLaP3/CoNLL98 Workshop on Paradigms and Grounding in Language Learning, ACL, pp 295-298. some elements have a specific behaviour: they never occur at the beginning or at the end of the sentences.",
        "For example, the English word the never ends the sentences.",
        "There exists in all the studied languages similar elements (words or morphemes) that we can consider as indicating the beginning or the end of structures, the grammatical words as well as the morphemes are consider as boundaries indicators.",
        "We systematically consider grammatical words either as beginning indicator or as ending indicator.",
        "In practice, we tie them to their nearest lexical element (the following lexical for beginnings and preceding lexical for endings) In the same way, prefixes are considered as beginning and suffixes as ending.",
        "For example, both postpositions and inflexional suffixes are consider as ending indicators.",
        "The structures generated by these elements correspond to a lexical element (the nucleus of the chunk) surrounded by grammatical elements (words or morphemes, generally a combination of both).",
        "The chunks may be viewed as non recursive phrases.",
        "Though each chunk of the corpus has not systematically boundaries indicators, there generally exists enough chunks which are delimited in order to allow the discovery of these boundaries.",
        "The discovery of such indicators is automatically realized for a large part.",
        "The last level is the clause level.",
        "By working on boundaries indicators, we have noted that some indicators have a more specific behaviour.",
        "They mainly occur at the beginning or at the end of sentences.",
        "Furthermore, since some chunks have the same behaviour, clause boundaries are indicated either by morpheme, sole grammatical words or chunks These elements always characterize elements of clauses: conjunctions or verbal phrases.",
        "For instance, English conjunction but begins sentences 672 times out of 760 occurrences.",
        "This behaviour is specific to clause boundaries indicators.",
        "German clause is, most of the times, closed either by grammatical words such as her, zuriick, verbal particles, or by verbal phrases.",
        "In Turkish, the conjunction ama (but) occurs 763 times and begins 743 times.",
        "The Turkish clause is closed by verbal chunks, which implies that all the verbal morphemes (-tir, yor) are well marked as absolute endings.",
        "All the languages which have a SOV or OSV structure offer obvious end boundaries for clauses, and languages which have VSO or VOS structure offer beginnings boundaries for clauses.",
        "These formal informations do not cover all the formal characteristics of the languages, but they offer enough informations in order to discover the different syntactic relations between chunks, and offer a good starting point in order to find specific structures of a language, the position of the finite verb in German for instance.",
        "In practice, we note that some languages privilege beginning indicators (prepositional languages as many European ones), others privilege ending indicators (postpositional languages as Turkish or Japanese) either at chunk level as at clause level, but they generally use the two methods.",
        "Some languages (Asian tonal languages) have a low number of boundaries indicators that complicates the chunks and clauses discovery.",
        "For the moment, we have stopped this study at clause level (or sequences of clause), but there perhaps exists higher levels."
