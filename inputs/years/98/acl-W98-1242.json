        "Natural language learning seems, from a formal point of view, an enigma.",
        "As a matter of fact, every human being, given nearly exclusively positive examples (as psycholinguists have noticed) is able at the age of about five to master his/her mother tongue.",
        "Though, no linguistically interesting class of formal languages is learnable with positive data in usual models (Gold's (67) and Valiant's (84)).",
        "To solve this paradox, various solutions have been proposed.",
        "Following the chomskian intuitions (Chomsky 65, 68), it can be admitted that natural languages belong to a restricted family and that the human mind includes an innate knowing of the structure of this class (Shinohara 90).",
        "Another approach consists in putting structural, statistical or complexity constraints on the examples proposed to the learner, making his/her inferences easier (Sakakibara 92).",
        "A particular family of research, more concerned with the cognitive relevance of its models, considers that in « natural » situations, examples are always provided with semantic and pragmatic information and tries to make profit of it (Anderson 77; Hamburger & Wexler 75 ; Hill 83; Langley 82).",
        "This is the family our research belongs to.",
        "But the property of meaningfulness of natural languages is computationally tractable only if we have at our disposal a theory that precisely articulates syntax and semantics.",
        "The strongest possible articulation is known as the Fredge's principle of compositionality.",
        "This principle has acquired an explicit formulation with the works of Richard Montague (Dowty, Wall & Peters 81; Montague 74) and his inheritors.",
        "We will first briefly recall an adapted version of this syntactico-semantic framework, based on a type of grammars called « classical categorial grammars >> (or CCGs), and we will then show how it can been used in a formal theory of natural language learning."

        "Previous models built in the syntactico-semantic spirit (Anderson 77, Hamburger & Wexler 75, Hill 83, Langley 82,) used more traditional syntax and semantic representations very close to syntactic structures (Pinker 79) : they failed to represent complex logical relations like quantification or Boolean operators.",
