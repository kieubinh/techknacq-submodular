        "In this paper we present one of the most significant system-architectural results relevant for NLG achieved within the KOMET-PAVE multimedia page generation experiment (GMD-IPSI: 1994-1996).1 Based on previous, separate experiences in natural language generation (see: Teich & Bateman 1994, Bateman & Teich 1995) and in automatic diagram design and visualization (see: Htiser, Reichenberger, Rostek & Streitz 1995), the KOMET-PAVE experiment sought to combine NLG and visualization into a single integrated information presentation system capable of producing effectively designed pages of information analogous to 'overviews' found in print-based publications such as encyclopediae or magazines.",
        "During this work, it became evident that there were significant overlaps both in the processes and organizations of data most supportive of information presentation.",
        "Moreover, the individual approaches offered complementary solutions for presentation subproblems that proved independent of the particular presentation modalities for which they were originally developed.",
        "A thorough architectural synthesis was therefore strongly indicated.",
        "The particular complementarity that provides the focus of the present paper is the following.",
        "First, it is widely accepted in both NLG and graphic design that the design decisions adopted must be sensitive not only to communicative purposes and the 'user' but also to contingent and emergent organizational properties of the data.",
        "However, the effectiveness of the solutions proposed for these is in complementary distribution across the two modalities.",
        "Approaches to respecting communicative purpose are underdeveloped in graphic design, while NLG has powerful techniques for imposing adherence to communicative purpose (e.g., goal-driven text planning); and, similarly, approaches to data-driven organization (i.e., 'aggregation') are comparatively weak in NLG, while automatic visualization now has a range of powerful techniques for identifying emergent organizational properties of large datasets.",
        "The architecture constructed in KOMET-PAVE builds on a combination of these individually developed techniques, resulting in a significant 'cross-fertilization' of approaches.",
        "IKomEr ('Knowledge-oriented production of multimodal documents') and PAVE (Publication and advanced visualization environments') were two departments of the German National Research Center for Information Technology's (GMD) institute for Integrated Publication and Information Systems (IPS1) in Darmstadt that cooperated closely for the work described in this paper.",
        "The authors would therefore like to thank all the members of those departments who contributed, and particularly Lothar Rostek, Melina Alexa, Elke Teich, Wiebke Mar and Klaas Jan Rondhuis.",
        "We organize the discussion as follows.",
        "We first introduce the visualization and automatic diagram design methods developed within the PAVE component of our system, drawing explicit attention to the similarities between the decisions made during diagram generation and those necessary during NL generation (Section 2).",
        "This provides necessary background to our claim that the methods and algorithms developed for visualization can also serve as a general solution to the problem of aggregation in tactical generation (Section 3).",
        "We then briefly show the same algorithms at work at the level of text organization, helping to motivate informational structures necessary for constraining page layout and for allocating presentation modalities in the complete page generation scenario (Section 4).",
        "We conclude the paper by summarizing the main points of architectural synthesis that we have pursued and outlining some prominent lines of ongoing work and future development."

        "I(g,m) is read \"object g has property m\" if g E G and m E M. Such a context is called a one-valued context.",
        "The one-valued context corresponding to the Profession-attribute of our example dataset is shown in the table to the left of Figure 1.",
        "The formal concepts of concern in FCA are defined as consisting of an extension and an intension, where the extension is a subset A of the set of objects G and the intension is a subset B of the set of attributes M. We call the pair (A, B) aforrnal concept if each element of the extension may be assigned each attribute of the intension.",
        "Thus, the pairs ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Urban Planner, Architect}) and ({A.Albers}, {Designer}) represent concepts with respect to the example one-valued context of Figure 1.",
        "More intuitively, in a formal context concepts represent rectangles of maximum size, completely filled with x's after permutation of rows and columns.",
        "The set of all concepts may be computed effectively using the algorithm \"Next Closure\" developed by Ganter & Wille (1996).",
        "The hierarchy relation \"subconcept\", established between the set of concepts, is based on inclusions of the respective extensions and intensions of the concepts.",
        "Concretely, a concept (A, B) is a subconcept of (A*, B*) if and only if A C A* -I.> B* C B.",
        "The main theorem of concept analysis shows that this \"subconcept\" relationship represents a complete lattice structure (see Wille 1982).",
        "Given all concepts, we may construct the concept lattice starting from the top concept (the one that has no superconcepts) and proceed top-down recursively.",
        "In each step we must compute the set of direct subcon-cepts and link them to the respective superconcept until we reach the greatest lower bound of the lattice itself (the existence of the bounds is always guaranteed if we consider finite input data structures).",
        "One efficient implementation of this algorithm is explained in greater detail in Kamps (1997).",
        "The corresponding lattice for the one-valued context shown in Figure 1 is shown to the right of the figure.",
        "The labelling of the nodes of the lattice makes full use of the dependencies and redundancies that the lattice captures.",
        "Elements of the extensions are shown moving up the lattice, the extension label for each node consists of just those elements which are added at each node, while the members of the intensions are shown moving down the lattice, again adding just those elements that are new for each node.",
        "Thus, for example, the node simply labelled Gropius, Breuer corresponds to the full formal concept ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Architect, Urban Planner}) since both Gropius and Breuer are added new to the extension at that node, while no new elements are added to the intension ('Architect' and 'Urban Planner' are both inherited from the two nodes above in the lattice, where they are already present)."

        "Here, however, the set of values W of the attributes is not trivial: to identify the value w E W of attribute m E M for an object g E G we adopt the notation m(g) = w and read this as \"attribute m of object g has value w\".",

        "Although this only considers pairwise mappings – that is such functional relationships that hold between two single domains – it simplifies the problem drastically and is a sensible approach for two reasons:- first, the isolated functional relationships may, as we will see, be arranged in the form of a dependency lattice that allows a wholistic view on the dependency structure, and second, it is computationally simple to achieve.",
        "The underlying principle is then straightforward: compute a (one-valued) dependency context from the given nary relation table and apply the techniques described above for the construction of the corresponding dependency lattice.",

        "The idea of this model, much abbreviated, is that the cardinality of the bottom domain is the largest, whereas the domains further up in the lattice contain less and less elements.",
        "Thus, the bottom domain is graphically encoded using so-called graphical elements (rectangle, circle, line, etc.",
        "), whereas the upper domains are encoded using their graphical attributes (colour, width, radius) as well as set-valued attributes (attachments of graphical elements) to keep graphical complexity moderate.",
        "Since functions and set-valued functions are binary relations, the encoding of a structured n-tuple is composed of a set of binary encodings.",

        "Indeed, textual representations of the example diagrams may be motivated from the dependency lattice structure by proceeding over all functional groupings and taking into account the position of the equalities in the lattice just as in the diagram generation.",
        "For instance, starting from equality m(g1) = m(g2) in the lattice, it is sensible to relate the fact that this dependency holds both for the schools and for the professions so that we may connect them in a single sentence: `g 1 ' (concerning Gropius) and `g2' (concerning Breuer) can be compactly expressed by collapsing their (identical) school and profession attributes.",
        "A similar phenomenon holds for grouping m(g3) = m(g4), which is shared by the periods and the schools: here, `g3' (concerning A. Albers) and `g4' (concerning J. Albers) may be succinctly expressed by collapsing their identical period and school attributes.",

        "Selecting a particular graphical element or attribute to realize some aspect of the data is an aggregation step.",
        "In this section, we show this in terms more familiar to NLG by briefly sketching how the approach handles one example of aggregation discussed in the literature: the production of concise telephone network planning reports illustrated by McKeown, Robin & Kukich (1995).",
        "One example from McKeown et al.",
        "(1995) concerns the data shown in Figure 4, again re-represented in tabular form.",
        "The attributes taken here are the semantic roles that might be used to provide input concerning 3 individual 'facts' (gl, g2, g3) to a tactical generation component.",

        "This is managed by means of the corresponding dependency lattice, which we also show in Figure 4, abbreviated and annotated somewhat here for ease of discussion.",
        "Analogously to the case for diagram generation, where several diagrams may be generated from a single lattice, a dependency lattice represents not a particular aggregation, but rather all possible aggregations in a single compact form.",
        "Input expressions for tactical generation can be constructed by working upwards from the bottom of the lattice.",
        "Each node with associated functional dependencies represents a point of possible aggregation.",
        "In the diagram, therefore, the lowest nodes in the lattice represent three starting points; from left to right: (i) aggregations of type, source and destination with respect to the major dimensions of actor, process, etc., and (ii) and (iii) source and destination with respect to a type.",
        "The righthand Type node then represents",
        "aggregation with respect to the major dimensions analogously to the left hand node.",

        "The motivation for such lowering is typically to be found in registerial constraints and the method of textual development being used in the text at hand.",
        "If the 'objects' of the domain (e.g., in this case, the cable) are to remain salient, then these can be redistributed from the uppermost node to enforce redundant expression; for example: It requested placement ...of a 48-fiber cable from CO to 1103 and 24-fiber cables from 1201 to 1301 and from 1401 to 1501 The other examples presented by McKeown et al.",
        "(1995), as well as other examples of similar phenomena presented in the literature (e.g., Dalianis & Hovy 1996) are handled similarly.",
        "Since the dependency lattice does not itself determine which of the possible aggregations is taken up, but simply represents what is possible, this approach turns aggregation into a process of communicative choice along exactly the same lines as all other choices in the grammar, semantics, text organization, etc.",
        "One of the major benefits of the dependency lattice is then to represent this space of possibilities compactly, allowing a more systematic weighing of alternatives.",
        "The possibilities for aggregation captured by a dependency lattice then largely remove the need for ad hoc specific rules of grouping.",
        "Nevertheless, the extraction of those dimensions of organization or aggregation that are particularly relevant for a specific text or diagram can only be determined from the communicative purpose of the text or diagram that is being constructed: i.e., which `question' is the text/diagram answering.",

        "There are several further lines of development that are now required to establish the full utility of the architecture.",
        "At present, we have not evaluated the kinds of variation that occur when aggregation is sought at all levels of representation as we propose: in particular, generic text stages and grammatical structures have not been included.",
        "In addition, the relationship between the top-down communicative goals and the particular selections of organizing dimensions to be exploited during aggregation needs further work.",
        "Nevertheless, it seems clear that, in its combination of modes and techniques of processing from the NL-generation and visualisation traditions, an improved level of overall functionality has been achieved.",
        "This is, of course, only a heuristic at this time and could easily require alteration – for example, with different communicative purposes or different output modalities (e.g., spoken language).",
        "Work in progress or preparation is now providing more efficient and robust implementations of the general dependency analyses and their encoding in graphical form, furthering the relationship between rhetorical structure and motivated layout, and seeking more empirically based statements of generic document layout, visualization and text type constraints that can provide more detailed constraints for the page generation process."
