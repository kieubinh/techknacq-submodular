        "As this section will illustrate shortly, different graphic designs may enhance or detract from a user's performance of certain types of perceptual and cognitive tasks.",
        "The philosophy of task-based graphic design is to design an information graphic based upon which perceptual and cognitive tasks the user wants or needs to perform.",
        "In our architecture (described more fully in the next section), the graphics generator reasons about what user tasks would enable the system's presentation'goals to be achieved, so that graphics can be designed to support those tasks (and thus support the presentation goals).",
        "Note that since the descriptions in our domain of application are often fairly complex (e.g., 90% of the total weight of the cargo arriving by day 25), we assume that a compositional approa.ch to representing attributive descriptions will facilitate the automatic transformation of presentation goals to user tasks.",
        "To see how different graphic designs about the same data may facilitate different tasks, consider, Figure 1.",
        "In (a), the table shows that Arlington's population is .5K, Berlin's is 1K, etc.",
        "Moreover, it is possible to compute from the data shown in it that Arlington's population is half that of Berlin's, that Berlin has the largest population, and that Berlin's population is greater than the population of all of the other towns combined.",
        "To facilitate just task (A), the task of looking up the population of a town given its name, then this table would be adequate.",
        "On the other hand, a bar chart such as the one shown in (b) would better support both tasks (A) and (B), where",
        "(B) is the task of determining the largest and the smallest town.",
        "(Each vertical bar represents a particular town and the height of a bar represents the population of the town represented by the bar.)",
        "Ordering the towns by population size, as in (c), further facilitates task (B), as can be seen by comparing (b) to (c).",
        "However, task (C), the task of comparing Berlin's population to the total population of all of the other towns, would be facilitated by the chart shown in (d).",
        "In it, task (C) is facilitated by enabling the user to count the divisions of each bar.",
        "Also, if task (A) is not required, it is not, necessary to provide numeric values on the horizontal axis in (d).",
        "Since in our approach the graphics generator reasons about what user tasks would enable the system's presentation goals to be achieved, it is important for the system to distinguish cases where the content of a description itself directly contributes to the presentation's goals, i.e., where the content has an attributive rather than a referential function.",
        "For instance, suppose that a system must design a graphic supporting the presentation goals described for example (3) above.",

        "Many researchers in natural language processing, e.g., [Moore1995], have modeled presentation design as a process of hierarchical planning to achieve communicative goals.",
        "Researchers in graphics have emphasized the need to design presentations that support the perceptual and logical tasks a user must perform [Besliers and Feiner1993, Casner1991, Roth and Mattis1990].",

        "(For simplicity, in the rest of this paper we shall refer to the genre-independent and media-independent level of the plan just as the media-independent level.)",
        "These media-independent goals are achieved by media-independent il-locutionary actions [Searle1970], e.g., Assert, and Recommend, which themselves are decomposed into media-independent actions that correspond to attributive and referential uses of descriptions.",
        "(The language used in our current system to express the content of illocutionary acts and goals is described in [Green et al.19981.",
        "In addition to application-specific terms, the language includes",
        "more broadly applicable terms for expressing quantitative relations and aggregate properties.)",
        "The media-independent plan is used by two media-specific generators (one for text, another for graphics) to create parts of the presentation.",
        "(The problems of media-allocation, how the system decides what parts of the presentation to realize in which media, and media-coordination, how it coordinates information conveyed in both media, are beyond the scope of this paper.)",
        "The text generator converts parts of the plan (as determined by the media-allocation, component) to functional descriptions (FDs) of sentential units, which specify, for example, semantic predicate-argument structure, open-class lexical items, and aspects of sentence structure with pragmatic import.",
        "The FDs are subsequently realized by a general-purpose sentence generator (FUF/SURGE) [Elhadad and Robin 1996].",
        "(Decisions regarding the content of referential descriptions and anaphora, which are made by the text generator, are beyond the scope of this paper.)",
        "The first stage of the graphics generator converts parts of the plan (as determined by the media-allocation component) to a sequence of logical user tasks that will enable the presentation's goals to be achieved; the task sequence is then input to the SAGE graphic design system [Roth and Mattis1990, Chuah et al.1995, Roth et al.1994], which automatically creates a graphic supporting the user's tasks.3 For example, the presentation goal that the user know the population of Arlington would be enabled if the user were able to perform the sequence of logical tasks of searching for Arlington in a graphic, finding its population attribute, and then looking up the value; furthermore, these tasks could be performed using a graphic such as (a) in Figure I.",

        "For example, Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the presentation operator that would be used to generate (3) above, in the formalism used by the presentation planner [Young1994].",
        "The strategy encoded in this decomposition is to recommend an action, as in (3)i, and to provide information that may motivate the audience to adopt the recommendation, as in (3)ii.",
        "The plan parameter ?p2 would be instantiated with the proposition describing the recommended action.",
        "The Motivate plan constraint of the operator would instantiate the plan variable ?pl with the proposition expressed in (3)ii.",
        "In our current system, the search for a proposition satisfying a constraint such as the Motivate constraint in the example is performed by accessing a database created by a domain-specific data analysis component.",
        "For example, in our current application domain the data analysis component analyzes transportation schedules and records features that may be of interest to the user.",
        "Propositions such as ?p2 and ?pl are represented in a RQFOL (first-order logic with restricted quantification).",
        "RQFOL has been used for representing the meaning of natural language queries involving complex referring expressions [Webber1983, Woods1983].",
        "In addition to providing a powerful, compositional representation scheme for the complex descriptions occurring in our domain,",
        "RQFOL distinguishes information about discourse referents from the main predication of an expression.",
        "For example, the Proposition plan constraint of the operator in Figure 2, makes use of the RQFOL representation of ?pl to extract information with which to instantiate the plan variables ?main-predl and ?refsl with the main predication of ?pi and a list describing the discourse entities [Webber1983] evoked or accessed by use of ?main-predl, respectively.",
        "(The significance to presentation generation of the distinction between the main predication and information about discourse referents is discussed in [Green et al.1998].)",
        "The step of the operator shown in Figure 2 underlying (3)ii is an Assert action.",
        "In general, Assert(?prop,?refs) is defined as the System asserts ?prop to the User, where ?refs is a list specifying all discourse entities evoked or accessed by use of ?prop.6 Discourse entities are specified in the list either by an internal identifier (an identifier referring to a database object) or by descriptions stated as RQFOL expressions.",
        "For example, consider the Assert action underlying (3)ii, which can be represented as follows:7 Assert(serves(SRI, d2), -",
        "• PRI, ?d1), (d2, (for the c:city(c) has-population(c,d3))) (d3, (for the y:int(y) max(y,d4))),",

        "Figure 3 shows the definition of an abstract Assert action and a simplified version of its decomposition.",

        "Predicate is used to describe an event independently of the things that play a role in that event.Activate-ko is a primitive action used to refer to an object, i.e., this corresponds to the referential use of a description.",
        "To achieve the effect of this action, the text and graphics generators are free to select any device that will enable the user to identify the object (subject to pragmatically appropriate identification constraints [Appelt and Kronfeld1987]).",
        "In other words, since the function of the description is purely referential, its content does not contribute directly to the presentation's goals and thus is not represented in the plan.",
        "Activate-as is used to refer to a discourse entity as the object fitting the description provided, i.e., this corresponds to the attributive use of a description.",
        "An Activate-as may itself be decomposed into these three types of subactions.",
        "During hierachical planning, the constraints of the Assert decomposition operator (shown in Figure 3) are used to instantiate the plan variables ?id-list and ?desc-list.",
        "In the fora!!",
        "step of the operator, an Activate-ko and Activate-as action is created for each element of ?id-list and ?desc-list, respectively.",
        "E.g., for the Assert shown above representing (3)ii, the ?id-list would contain the identifiers MI and $SOMERSET, and ?desc-list would include the descriptions of d2 through d5.",
        "Then, the Assert shown above would be partly decomposed into attributive and referential communicative actions as follows: SRI is the object of an Activate-ko act, and d2 is decomposed into an Activate-as act describing d2, which in turn is decomposed into an Activate-as describing d3, and so on, ending with an Activate-ko to enable the audience to identify $SOMERSET.",
        "In general, a complex attributive description may contain one or more Activate-ko acts.",
        "That is, our representation scheme supports the composition of descriptions for attributive use from subcomponents whose use may be attributive or referential.",
        "Thus, in this example, $SOMERSET could be described in a number of ways, e.g., Somerset County or the county on the eastern side of Westmoreland County.",
        "To summarize the process of generating attributive descriptions in our approach, discourse strategies such as Recommend-act (shown in Figure 2) determine content selection as well as whether the selected information will be presented as part of the main predication or as part of an attributive description.",
        "The illocutionary act operators (e.g., Assert) and Activate-as operator further.",
