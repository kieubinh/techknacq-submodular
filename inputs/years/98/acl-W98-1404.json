        "Many models of text generation make use of standard patterns (whether expressed as schemas (e.g. [McKeown 85]) or plan operators (e.g. [Moore and Paris 93])) to break down communicative goals in such a way as to produce extended texts.",
        "Such models are making two basic assumptions:",
        "1.",
        "Text generation is goal directed, in the sense that spans and subspans of text are designed to achieve unitary communicative goals [Grosz and Sidner 86].",
        "2.",
        "Although the details of the structure of a text may have to be tuned to particulars of the communicative situation, generally the structure is determined by the goals and their decomposition.",
        "That is, a generator needs strategies for decomposing the achievement of complex goals into sequences of utterances, rather than ways of combining sequences of utterances into more complex structures.",
        "Generation is \"top-down\", rather than \"bottom-up\" [Marcu 97].",
        "Our belief is that there is an important class of NLG problems for which these basic assumptions are not helpful.",
        "These problems all involve situations where semi-fixed explanation strategies are less useful than the ability to exploit opportunities.",
        "WordNet gives the following definition of \"opportunity\": Opportunity: \"A possibility due to a favorable combination of circumstances\" Because opportunities involve combinations of circumstances, they are often unexpected and hard to predict.",
        "It may be too expensive or impossible to have complete knowledge about them.",
        "Top-down generation strategies may not be able to exploit opportunities (except at the cost of looking for all opportunities at all points) because it is difficult to associate classes of opportunities with fixed stages in the explanation process.",
        "We are investigating opportunistic text generation in the Intelligent Labelling Explorer (ILEX) project, which seeks automatically to generate a sequence of commentaries for items in an electronic",
        "catalogue (or museum gallery) in such a way as to reflect the interest of the user and also to further certain educational (or other) aims.",
        "The current domain of the system is the 20th Century Jewellery Exhibit in the Royal Museum of Scotland but ILEX is designed to work with any domain where object descriptions are required.",
        "In ILEX, the system has an agenda of communicative, goals to achieve, which reflect the goals of the curators.",
        "The user has the freedom to look at any object in the gallery at any time.",
        "The system produces a description of each object asked for by the user, such that each description contributes as best it can to the system's goals and the sequence of descriptions fits together into a coherent whole.",
        "The result is a variety of mixed-initiative dialogue, in which the user is in control of the high-level communicative goal (what gets described) but the system is in control of how the goal is realised (how the chosen object is described).",
        "In such a dynamically unfolding environment, it is not possible to predict all possible paths through the interaction.",
        "The system must thus be ready to exploit opportunities in order to achieve its goals.",
        "In ILEX, the user's arbitrary choice represents a horizon beyond which is it not practical to predict.",
        "Each generated page may be the last one to be generated and therefore has to be planned to achieve as much as possible on its own.",

        "A museum curator seeks to achieve general educational goals through the description of a set of carefully selected objects.",
        "In general, the goals are to convey important generalisations (e.g. \"Organic jewellery tends to have natural themes\") and to dispel important misconceptions (e.g. \"Jewellery tends to be made of expensive materials\").",
        "These important points have to be brought in appropriately during the description of the exhibits which are selected by the visitor.",
        "In order to see how a human being tackles such complex goals, we performed a \"Curator of Oz\" experiment, in which we chose an arbitrary sequence of exhibits in the 20th Century Jewellery gallery of the National Museum of Scotland and asked the curator to give us a commentary.",
        "The curator introduced general points/themes suggested by the objects, moving from the objects to the general issues surrounding them, using the objects merely as an excuse to introduce these topics, for instance as in the following (\"V\" indicates the visitor and \"C\" the curator): V: \"There's a set of three objects here.\" C: \"What these symbolise for me are the preoccupations of the 1980's with...\" She reinforced points from the past, exploiting an excuse to come back to an important point that has already been made and show its relevance in a new situation: V: \"This one here...\" C: \"Yes, you've made a link with the first piece that we looked at, which is the idea of a jewel which is also a work of art and a sculpture...\" She also made links to previous items, thereby improving the continuity of the discourse: C: \"... and it was work like this which directly inspired work like the Roger Morris brooch on the stand which we looked at earlier.\"",
        "All of these can be regarded as ways of exploiting opportunities offered by the situation.",
        "There is nothing like a conventional schema structure to the descriptions produced.",
        "The approach looks a lot more like putting together arbitrary pieces of interesting material subject to only very loose retrictions.",
        "This may not be the best way to produce a carefully-argue& written text, and clearly the result is not always fluent according to stringent criteria.",
        "In some – but not all – respects, it resembles the unplanned discourses discussed by [Ochs 79].",
        "Furthermore, in the interactive and relatively informal setting of a museum tour, it works.",
        "We thus decided that ILEX should have a whole set of goals about things to say.",
        "These are linked into a single metalevel goal, which is something like \"to achieve as many of the individual goals as possible, within the space available, in the context of a globally coherent discourse which maintains the reader's interest\"."

        "• Expanding \"sketchy plans\" as needed, taking into account the current state of the world.",
        "• Flexible choice of tasks from an agenda.",
        "• Recognition of opportunities through detection of reference features, followed by more thorough analysis.",
        "Pryor's work is implemented in PARETO, a planner for a simulated robot delivery vehicle., The vehicle is given orders to deliver various objects to various building sites, and needs to locate these objects at other sites.",
        "The system is opportunistic in that while the truck is working on one goal, it is always ready to switch to another if an object on its find-and-deliver list turns up.",
        "For example, if the truck stops at one place to pick up a hammer, it may notice a saw, which is also on its list, and thus pick it up and proceed to its delivery point.",
        "Pryor's planning occurs within a limited horizon – the robot only has certain knowledge in regards to the immediate location, and outside of that, the world is uncertain (objects are sometimes randomly moved between sites in the world).",
        "ILEX inhabits a world analogous in certain respects to PARETO's: each page is a site on the map, and it is up to us to find opportunities for realising our goals at each site.",
        "However, while in the truck world the system is in control of motion to the next site, in the museum, it is the user who chooses the next page.",
        "Conversely, while objects outside the truck's immediate vicinity may move autonomously, for ILEX, facts and their values do not change.",
        "Opportunistic planning has similarities with a number of other approaches to planning.",
        "It shares with incremental planning (used in NLG by [Cawsey 92]) the idea of starting to execute a plan before the plan is complete, and being prepared to repair the partial plan in the light of feedback.",
        "It shares with reactive planning the idea of being directed as much by the characteristics of the state of the world at execution time as by the pursuit of preconceived goals.",
        "However, unlike pure reactive planning it does acknowledge the need for explicit plans to be manipulated and it",
        "differs from many models of incremental planning in the extent to which the original plan can be diverted to exploit the characteristics of the world at execution time."
