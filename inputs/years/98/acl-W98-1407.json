        "A frequently encountered problem in urban life is the use of public transportation: we have to get from here to there and quite so often we don't know how.",
        "As it is not always possible to get help from a person (be it because nobody is available, or able to speak our language), we might appreciate assistance of a machine.",
        "In order to convey to the user \"useful information\", we must define what \"usefulness\" Means.",
        "For example, if we tell someone how to get from one place to another, we hardly ever specify all the intermediate steps, in particular if there is no ambiguity.",
        "Also, not all information is of equal weight.",
        "Yet, as we will show, the notion of \"relative importance\" of information is gradual in nature rather than discrete, that is a simple binary value (important vs. unimportant)'.",
        "All this reflects, of course, in the content and form of the final text.",
        "Relative importance is signaled by different means at the text level (headers, paragraphs, etc.)",
        "and at the sentence level (word choice, syntactic structure: main clause versus subordinate clause, topic-comment structures).",
        "Concerning the prominence status (i.e. relative importance of a piece of information), semioticians and text linguists have reached a similar conclusion by distinguishing between the \"foreground/background\" or \"primary/secondary level\" of a text [Bar66, vD77, AP89, Com92].",
        "According to Combettes [Com92], the \"primary level\" deals with the core meaning, i.e. events and facts that make the text progress, while the \"secondary level\" deals with descriptions, evaluations, comments, and reformulations The distinction of levels, with information of varying shades (salience gradation), implies that it should be possible to identify corresponding linguistic \"markers\" for each one of them.",
        "Yet, as Combettes has pointed out [Com92], the means used for marking the relative importance of information may vary from one type of text to another.",
        "Nevertheless, certain markers do hold",
        "regardless of the text type.",
        "This is particularly true for certain syntactic devices such as subordinate clauses, appositions, nominalization, all of which are, according to Combettes, markers of the secondary level, unlike main clauses which mark the primary level.",
        "Analyzing a corpus of route descriptions in French we have identified correlations between the salience status of specific conceptual chunks (landmarks, segment distance, etc.)",
        "and linguistic structures (independent vs. subordinate clauses).",
        "In section 2, we will reveal how the 'salience status of some types of information may affect the content and form of the final text.",

        "The information contained in subway route descriptions can be divided into two broad categories: \"global\" and \"local\" information.",
        "We describe each one of them below, illustrating particular information types with examples taken from the corpus.",
        "Global information: • identification of the route by specifying departure and destination, eg.",
        "Potir oiler de Saint-Lazare a Jussieu...",
        "I To go from Saint-Lazare to Jussieu... • comments concerning the complexity of the whole route, eg.",
        "C'est simple et rapide, pas de changement.",
        "I It's simple and fast, no transfer.",
        "• information concerning the distance of the whole trip, • eg.",
        "ça doit faire 7 ou 8 stations en tout.",
        "I This should make 7 or 8 stops for the whole trip.",
        "Local information: • stop of departure, eg.",
        "A partir de Jussieu, tu prends...",
        "I Starting from Jussieu, you take... • destination, eg.",
        "tu arrives a Gare de Lyon I you arrive at Gare de Lyon • lines to take, eg.",
        "prendre la ligne 5 I take the line number 5 • transfers, eg.",
        "changer a Opera I change at Opera • directions to take, eg.",
        "tu prends la direction Gallieni I you take the direction Gallieni • partial distances to cover, eg.",
        "ii y a une seule station I there is only one stop",
        "According to Wunderlich and Reinelt [WR82], \"local information\" is the core of route descriptions, while \"global information\" is additional as it serves mainly interactional purposes.",
        "In the remainder of our analysis we will concentrate on the \"local route information\" and the way it is expressed in the domain of subway route descriptions, the objective being to determine whether some information is obligatory or not.",
        "Of course, we could have defined on a priori grounds what should be mentioned explicitly and what not.",
        "Yet, we preferred to ground our work on empirical data.",
        "We assume that \"obligatory information\" is information that is contained in all descriptions of the corpus, whereas \"optional information\" occurs only occasionally'.",
        "We have also tried to find explanations for the omission of optional information.",
        "For example, the stations of departure and destination could be considered as optional, since they are already known by the \"questioner\" (either because they are a part of the question, or because they are given with the context/situation).",
        "Indeed, our data reveal that, while the destination stop is always mentioned, the departure is mentioned only in 50% of the cases (eg.",
        "A Jussieu, tu prends... / At Jussieu, you take...).",
        "In the light of these data we conclude that it is useful to make a distinction between given and new, or known and unknown information.",
        "The problem concerning the \"known\" information is to decide whether to make it explicit or not.",
        "This is not a conceptual problem, – the known information must already be present at the conceptual level, – the choice is pragmatic in nature (what information should be conveyed, because it is really useful?",
        "), with possible stylistic side effects.",
        "For example, the fact that the destination (known information) is mentioned systematically in the corpus seems to be based on \"stylistic\" considerations: if it were not, the description would look like being incomplete.",
        "On the other hand, decisions concerning \"new\" information do involve conceptual choices.",
        "They consist in determining whether to include a given piece of information in the message or not, and in determining its degree of salience.",
        "The rest of our paper deals only with the analysis of \"new\" information, since we are mainly interested in the choices at the conceptual level and their consequences on the linguistic form.",
        "As the data show, information concerning transfer stations and directions of lines is obligatory: both types of information systematically occur in the corpus.",
        "The corpus also reveals that information concerning partial distances (number of stops to travel on a given line) and the names of the lines (eg.",
        "\"line 7\" or \"orange line\") is optional.",
        "It shouldbe noted, that partial distance may be represented in two ways in the domain of subway route descriptions: either as the length of a route segment (eg.",
        "\"two stops\"), or as the result of the number of stops counted (eg.",
        "\"second stop\").",
        "This kind of information is not mentioned at all in 30% of the cases.",
        "We have noticed that the inclusion/exclusion of information concerning partial distances depends on contextual factors such as the \"value\" of the distance itself (one stop vs. several) and the position on the route (last route segment or not).",
        "A \"one-stop distance\" is more important than a segment containing several stops.",
        "Also, the distance of the last segment seems to be more important than the distances of the intermediate segments (unless they are equal to one stop).",
        "Other strategies concerning information on partial distances have been observed: some subjects have mentioned all of them in each one of their description, regardless of the number of stops and the relative position of the segment, while others did not mention them at all.",
        "Another kind of optional information are the names of the lines to take.",
        "This may vary from place to place, but at least in Paris it is the direction (final destination) of the train that tells the user which train to take.",
        "The names of the lines, represented by numbers, were omitted in one third of the descriptions in the corpus.",
        "In the next section we describe the results of our linguistic analysis.",
