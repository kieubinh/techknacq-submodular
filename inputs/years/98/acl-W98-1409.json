        "Expert systems were one of the first applications to emerge from initial research in artificial intelligence, and the explanation of expert system reasoning was one of the first applications of natural language generation.' This is because the need for explanations is obvious, and generation from a knowledge-based application such as reasoning should be relatively straightforward.",
        "However, while explanation has been universally acknowledged as a desirable functionality in expert systems, natural language generation has not taken a central place in contemporary expert system development.",
        "For example, a popular text book about expert systems such as (Giarratano and Riley, 1994) stresses twice in the introduction the importance of explanation, but provides no further mention of explanation in the remaining 600 pages.",
        "(The book is based on the popular CLIPS framework.)",
        "In this paper, we present a new approach to enhancing an expert system with an explanation facility.",
        "The approach comprises both software components and a methodology for assembling the components.",

        "We present our analysis of knowledge types in Section 3.",

        "A very important early result (based on experiences with explanation2 in systems such as MYCIN (Shortliffe, 1976)) was the finding that \"reasoning strategies employed by programs do not form a good basis for understandable explanations\" (Moore, 1994, p.31).",
        "Specifically, simply paraphrasing the chain of reasoning of the expert system does not let a human user easily understand that reasoning.",
        "Two separate approaches have been proposed to address this problem:",
        "• In the Explainable Expert System (EES) approach (Swartout et al., 1991; Swartout and Moore, 1993), the knowledge representation used by the expert system is enriched to include explicit \"strategic\" knowledge, i.e., knowledge about how to reason, and domain-specific knowledge.",
        "From this knowledge, the rules used by the expert system are compiled, and this knowledge is also used to provide more abstract explanations of the system's reasoning.",
        "• In the Reconstructive Explainer (Rex) approach (Wick, 1993), the expert system is un",
        "changed, but after it has performed its reasoning, a causal chain for explanation is constructed from the input data to the conclusion reached previously by the expert system as a separate process.",
        "The work of (Tanner et al., 1993) can also be seen as falling in this paradigm, since a separate representation of knowledge (the \"functional representation\") is used only for explanation, and the explanation must be specially derived from this.",
        "These approaches have in common a preoccupation with a categorization of knowledge used in the system into different types.",
        "EES concentrates on an abstract representation of strategic knowledge (how does a particular action of the system relate to the overall goal?)",
        "and on the representation of design rationale (why are actions reasonable in view of domain goals?).",
        "In addition, there is terminological domain knowledge (definitions of terms).",
        "Rex and related approaches have a representation of domain knowledge, along with domain rule knowledge (mainly causality), which is completely separate from that used by the expert system itself.",
        "This knowledge is used to derive an \"explanation path\" through the domain knowledge representation.",
        "There are problems with both approaches.",
        "EES has not proven to be a fully satisfactory solution to the problem of expert system explanation.",
        "The problem is that the writers of expert systems have not been too quick or too eager to adopt frameworks such as EES.",
        "The requirement for a more abstract representation of knowledge (from which the actual expert system rules are compiled) that EES imposes may be considered onerous by the expert system developer, appearing unmotivated from the point of view of the core functionality of the system, namely reasoning (as opposed to explanation).",
        "Presumably, it is difficult for one and the same person to be a domain expert and a expert on communication in the domain.",
        "In the Rex approach, the obvious problem is that in order to generate an explanation, additional reasoning must be performed which in some sense is very similar to that done by the expert",
        "system itself (e.g., finding causal chains) This is redundant, and does not result in a clear separation between reasoning and explanation.",
        "While Wick (1993) argues against such a separation on philosophical grounds, practical constraints suggest, as indicated above, that the domain expert responsible for implementing the reasoning system should not also be responsible for implementing the explanation capability, and that the communication engineer (responsible for implementing the explanation facility) should not need to replicate domain reasoning.",
        "In this paper, we present a new approach (architecture and methodology) to expert system explanation which does not require the expert system writer to take into account the needs of the explanation while writing the rules.",
        "At the same time, we avoid the necessity of having a separate domain reasoning component for the explanation generation.",
        "Instead, the expert system is largely considered a standalone application, onto which explanation is added.",
        "However, this is done by having a communication engineer design a second knowledge representation (separate from the expert system's domain knowledge representation) specifically for the purpose of communicating explanations.",
        "This representation is instantiated by the expert system as it reasons, not by a separate module after reasoning has occurred.",
        "Thus, no separate reasoning facility is needed."

        "We follow previous work in distinguishing different types of knowledge.",
        "However, use operational criteria: we classify knowledge by what it is used for and who is responsible for its engineering, not by its structure or contents.",
        "We briefly present our classification here and illustrate it on an example in the following section.",
        "• Reasoning domain knowledge (RDK).",
        "This is knowledge about the domain needed to perform the reasoning.",
        "Typically, it includes rules, terminological knowledge, and instance knowledge.",
        "It is encoded by the domain expert in the expert system proper.",
        "• Communication domain knowledge (CDK).",
        "This is knowledge about the domain which is needed for communication about the domain.",
        "It typically is a different \"view\" on the domain knowledge than RDK, and may include additional information not needed for the reasoning itself.",
        "It is encoded by the communication engineer in the explanation facility.",
        "• Domain communication knowledge (DCK).",
        "This is knowledge about how to communi",
        "cate in the domain.",
        "DCK typically includes strategies for explanation in the given domain, and knowledge how to describe the entities of the domain.",
        "It is encoded by the communication engineer in the explanation facility.",
        "The distinctions may at first seem overly fine-grained.",
        "However, each type of knowledge is distinguished from the other types.",
        "CDK is domain knowledge, but it is 'domain knowledge that is needed only for communication, not for reasoning (as is RDK).",
        "RDK and CDK of course overlap, but they are not identical.",
        "This is in fact the lesson from much previous work in expert system explanation, for example the work of Paris et al.",
        "(1988) contrasting \"the line of reasoning\" and \"the line of explanation\", and the claim of Swartout et al.",
        "(1991) that the domain representation must be augmented with additional knowledge about the domain and about reasoning in the domain.",
        "Many researchers have identified the need for packaging domain knowledge differently for",
        "communication.",
        "For example, the \"views\" of Lester and Porter (1997) can be seen as a form of CDK, though they are not a declarative representation.",
        "What is new in our work, however, is the proposal that CDK should be represented explicitly in a distinct representation from the domain knowledge.3 CDK is different from DCK in that CDK is knowledge about the domain as it is needed for communication, but DCK is knowledge about how to communicate in that domain (and in a specific communicative setting characterized by factors as diverse as communication type or genre, hearer needs, communication medium, or cultural context).",
        "Therefore, for expert system explanation applications, CDK is conceptual knowledge (what conceptual content must be conveyed to the user to explain system reasoning effectively?",
        "), while DCK is knowledge about language use (how do we use linguistic acts to explain system reasoning effectively?",
        ").4 DCK may be expressed in communicative plan operators which achieve goals related to the hearer's cognitive state, while CDK would never include plan operators related to the hearer's cognitive state because the hearer is not part of the domain of the expert system."
