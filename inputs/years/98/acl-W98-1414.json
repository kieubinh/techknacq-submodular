        "In text, discourse markers signal the kind of coherence relation holding between adjacent text spans; for example, because, since, and for this reason are different markers for causal relations.",
        "For any but the most simple applications of text generation, marker selection is an important aspect of producing cohesive text.",
        "However, present systems use markers in fairly simplistic ways and cannot make use of the full potential of markers that language offers for a given relation.",
        "To improve this situation, we propose a specialized lexicon for discourse markers, which holds the relevant constraints and preferences associated with the markers, and which can be used by a text generator to make an informed choice among alternative ways of expressing a relation in the given context.",
        "We demonstrate how the lexicon can be employed in the generation process and propose to perform discourse marker choice in the sentence planning stage, where the interactions with other generation decisions can be accounted for."

      "text": [
        "When a coherence relation ties two adjacent portions of text together, it is often lexically signalled on the linguistic surface with a suitable word-----most often a conjunction, but also a preposition, a prepositional phrase or an adverb [Quirk et al.",
        "1972].",
        "The set of words from these grammatically heterogeneous classes that can signal coherence relations we call discourse markers.",
        "For example, the CONCESSION relation in English can be signalled with the subordinator although, the adverb still, the preposition despite, and a number of other words.",
        "For most coherence relations, language offers quite a variety of such markers, as several studies of individual relations have demonstrated (see references in Section 2).",
        "Accordingly, from the generation perspective, a serious choice task arises if the produced text is not only to simply signal the coherence relation, but moreover to reflect pragmatic goals, stylistic considerations, and the different connotations markers have.",
        "The importance of these factors was stressed by Scott and de Souza [1990], who gave a number of informal heuristics for when and how to signal the presence of coherence relations in text.",
        "Fleshing out the choice task in order to come up with a computational model, though, reveals two sources of difficulty.",
        "For one thing, in addition to syntactic variety, the precise semantic and pragmatic differences between similar markers can be quite difficult to determine.",
        "For instance, the CONCESSION markers although and evep though differ merely in emphasis; the CAUSE markers because and since differ in whether they mark the following information as given or not; the German CAUSE markers weil and denn differ in the illocution type of the conjuncts (proposition versus statement).",
        "Second,",
        "the dependencies between marker choice and other generation decisions are rather intricate.",
        "The idea of avoiding them is, presumably, the reason for the simplistic treatment of marker choice in typical generators to-date: They regard discourse markers as mere consequences of the structural decisions, hence do not perform any choice.",
        "We wish to demonstrate, however, that this strategy, which is typical for dealing with closed-class lexical items in general, is too great a simplification in these cases.",
        "In this paper, we propose to use a discourse marker lexicon as a declarative resource for the sentence planning stage of the text generation process.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 examines the role of discourse markers in NLG and reviews the state of the art.",
        "Section 3 briefly summarizes the ideas on sentence planning that have arisen in the past few years and argues that for a sophisticated treatment of discourse marker choice, a dedicated lexicon is to be used as one information resource in sentence planning.",
        "Section 4 introduces the discourse marker lexicon we are currently developing, and Section 5 describes how this lexicon can be usefully employed in the sentence planning phase to realize more flexible marker production."

        "Research on connectives in the context of NLG has focused on the selection of markers to produce coherent and cohesive multi-sentential text.",
        "Studies fall into two distinct groups: First, studies are concerned with identifying the characteristic properties of a small set of similar markers, and determining the reasons behind choosing a particular marker from this set in a given context; examples are the markers since and because [Elhadad and McKeown 1990], or the temporal markers before and while [Dorr and Gaasterland 1995].",
        "Second, a number of studies take particular (RST-)relations as a starting-point, and examine how these relations are signalled on the linguistic surface; examples are the PURPOSE, RESULT and PRECONDITION relations [Vander Linden 1994], the CONCESSION relation [Grote et al.",
        "1997], and the subject-matter relations occurring in a technical domain [Wisner and Stede 1992, Delin et al.",

        "Our work aims at enabling generators to truly choose discourse markers on the basis of generation parameters and context.",
        "This way, we gain variety in marker usage that is not just random but controlled.",
        "Furthermore, we are interested in a uniform, declarative representation of the information necessary.",
        "Approaches that encode marker choice in the grammar (such as Vander Linden [1994]), while certainly an improvement over previous 1:1 mappings between relations and markers, loose flexibility when it comes to account for the interactions between marker choice and other sentence planning decisions.",
        "These considerations led us to develop a lexicon of discourse markers.",
        "While its construction is still in progress, we have shown samples of the kind of representations we are aiming at, and we have demonstrated how such lexicon entries can be employed as a resource in the sentence planning phase of the generation process.",
        "In our framework, lexicon entries consist of applicability conditions (for deciding whether the marker is a candidate at all), partial sentence semantic specifications (for combining the marker with neighbouring constituents), and distinguishing features for paradigmatic choice.",
        "We have described how an input discourse structure tree can be linearized into a sequence",
        "of sentence plans, given a sentence planner that exploits the information supplied by a discourse marker lexicon."
