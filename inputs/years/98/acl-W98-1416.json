        "In this paper, we describe the operation of our argument-generation system, NAG (Nice Argument Generator).",
        "We consider its content planning and argument presentation processes, and discuss the attentional mechanism used in both of these processes.",
        "Given a goal proposition, NAG's objective is to generate a nice argument for it, by which we mean one which achieves a balance between what is normatively justifiable and what persuades the interlocutor.",
        "To this end, NAG consults a normative model, which contains our best understanding of the domain of discourse, and a model of the user's beliefs.",
        "The main modules of the system are shown in Figure 1.",
        "The Strategist drives the argumentation process.",
        "During argument generation, it activates a generation-analysis cycle as follows (Section 3).",
        "First, it invokes the Attentional Mechanism (Section 4) to activate salient propositions, which are used to construct an initial Argument Graph for an argument, or to extend an already existing Argument Graph.",
        "(An Argument Graph is a network with nodes that represent propositions, and links that represent the inferences that connect these propositions.)",
        "The Strategist then calls the Generator to continue the argument building process (Section 5).",
        "The Generator in turn fleshes out the Argument Graph by activating Reasoning Agents, which consult several sources of information, and incorporating the inferences and propositions returned by these agents into the Argument Graph.",
        "This Argument Graph is returned to the Strategist, which passes it to the Analyzer in order to evaluate its niceness and check for reasoning flaws (Section 6).",
        "If the Analyzer indicates that the argument is not nice enough, i.e., there is not sufficient belief in the goal in the user or the normative model, then the Strategist re-activates the Generator in order to find further support for the premises in the argument, and so on.",
        "The generation-analysis cycle continues until a sufficiently nice Argument Graph is generated.",
        "This graph is then passed to the Argument Presenter, which selects an argumentation strategy and determines propositions to be removed from the argument, aiming to produce a simpler, enthymematic argument.",
        "After each removal, the Presenter activates the Analyzer to check whether the argument is still nice and the Attentional Mechanism to determine whether the argument can still be followed by the user.",
        "Thus, the Attentional Mechanism is used in two different stages of the argumentation process.",
        "During argument generation, it focuses the argument construction process on concepts which are related to the",
        "goal, avoiding some distractions.",

        "NAG uses items in the user's focus of attention to guide a series of generation-analysis cycles which result in the generation of an Argument Graph that is both normatively acceptable and persuasive.",
        "Attentional focus also supports the generation of enthymematic arguments.",
        "NAG was written in Common Lisp.",
        "It was tested on five sample scenarios with ICBs containing up to 200 propositions.",
        "The simulation of attention via spreading activation generally led to a significant speedup in content planning times, with little effect on the generated arguments [Zukennan et al., 1998].",
        "Content planning times slowed down when extremely slow decay factors and low activation thresholds were used",
        "and when extremely fast decay factors and high activation thresholds were used.",
        "The former incorporated into the Argument Graph nodes that were only marginally related to the goal, while the latter incorporated too few nodes, resulting in essentially a goal-based search for an argument.",
        "We conducted a preliminary Web-based evaluation of NAG's content planning component.",
        "This evaluation consisted of giving respondents pretest questions regarding certain propositions in an asteroid argument similar to that discussed in this paper, and then presenting them with hand-generated renditions of an asteroid argument which took into account the responses to these questions.",
        "A post-test was used to determine the effect of the argument.",
        "This test showed a clear tendency among the respondents to shift belief towards the targets as a result of NAG's argument.",
        "A more rigorous evaluation of the content planning component and an evaluation of the argument presentation component will be performed in the next months."
