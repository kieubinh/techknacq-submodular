        "Hebrew includes a very productive noun-compounding construction called smixut.",
        "Because smixut is marked morphologically and is restricted by many syntactic constraints, it has been the focus of many descriptive studies in Hebrew grammar.",
        "We present the treatment of smixut in HUGG, a FUF-based syntactic realization system capable of producing complex noun phrases in Hebrew.",
        "We contrast the treatment of smixut with noun-compounding in English and illustrate the potential for paraphrasing it introduces.",
        "We specifically address the issue of determining when a smixut construction can be generated as opposed to other semantically equivalent constructs.",
        "We investigate several competing hypotheses - smixut is lexically, semantically and/or pragmatically determined.",
        "For each hypothesis, we explain why the decision to produce a smixut construction cannot be reduced to a computation over features produced by an outside module that would not need to know about the smixut phenomenon.",
        "We conclude that smixut provides yet another theoretical example where the interface that a syntactic realization component presents to the other components of a generation architecture cannot be made as isolated as we would hope.",
        "While the syntactic constraints on smixut are encapsulated within HUGG, the input specification language to HUGG must contain a feature that specifies that smixut is requested if possible.",
        "However, because smixut accounts for close to half the cases of NP modifiers observed on a corpus of complex NPs, and it appears to be the unmarked realization form for some frequent semantic relations, we empirically evaluate a default setting strategy for the feature use-smixut based on a simple semantic classification of the relations head-modifier in the NP.",
        "This study provides a solid ground for the definition of a small set of predicates in the input specification language to HUGG, that has applications beyond the selection of smixut – for the determination of the order of modifiers in the NP and the use of stacking vs. conjunction – and for the definition of a bilingual input specification language."

        "Over the past three years, we have started developing HUGG, a syntactic realization component for Hebrew.",
        "One of our objectives is to investigate constraints on the design of the input specification language to a syntactic realization component through a contrastive analysis of the requirements of English and Hebrew.",
        "By design, we are attempting to keep the input to HUGG as similar as possible to the one we defined in the SURGE syntactic realization for English [1.",
        "A detailed",
        "analysis of syntactic constructs specific to Hebrew becomes, therefore, critical to evaluate to which extent the input specification language can abstract away from knowledge of the syntax.",
        "We investigate in this paper one such construct: the Hebrew noun-compounding form known as smixut.",
        "Because smixut is morphologically marked and remarkably productive in Hebrew, there exists a vast tradition of work in descriptive grammar of Hebrew providing functional analysis of the phenomenon [11] [10] [13].",
        "This previous work has served as a fertile ground for our own generation-specific purposes.",
        "The specific issue we discuss in this paper is: what information in the input specification to the syntactic realization component can license the selection of a smixut construct.",
        "The classical objectives of modularity and knowledge encapsulation indicate that this decision should be a private decision of the syntactic realization component.",
        "Because there are so many syntactic constraints on the use of smixut, the objective of encapsulation is made even more desirable.",
        "After a thorough analysis of the different functions of the smixut construct and the constraints over its use, our conclusion, however, is that this reductionist strategy fails: we cannot explain the selection of a smixut construct without considering simultaneously lexical, semantic and pragmatic factors.",
        "Theoretically, in order to allow the syntactic realization component to select a smixut construct adequately, we are, therefore, left with two options: (1) either provide full, detailed access from the syntactic realization component to the complex semantic and pragmatic features that can impact on the decision; or else, (2) allow the other components to request the use of a smixut construct when they deem it adequate.",
        "In either case, modularity and encapsulation suffer.",
        "This analysis informs us in our design of a bilingual realization component: if a feature like use-smixut is required in the input to the syntactic component, this level of abstraction cannot be appropriate as a bilingual construction.",
        "It also informs us in the general ongoing debate over the design of reusable syntactic components and their place in the architecture of generators.",
        "From a more pragmatic perspective, however, we also provide a set of simple defaults for the generation of smixut based on a simple semantic classification of the relations head-modifier.",
        "We evaluate the validity of this classification by constructing input specifications for a corpus of more than 800 complex noun phrases and regenerating from them.",
        "The validation process includes two aspects: (1) we test that human coders agree on the semantic relations they use to label complex NPs; and (2) we verify that the generator's decision to produce a smixut construction corresponds to that observed in the corpus.",
        "Preliminary results are provided in Section 4.3.",
        "They encourage us to view in the set of semantic relations we propose a useful basis for the design of an interlingual input specification language.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we first briefly review the main approaches to the treatment of noun-compounds in English and in Hebrew.",
        "In Section 3 we provide descriptive data on the use of smixut in Hebrew.",
        "We then describe in Section 4 a first approach to the generation of smixut based on a simple semantic classification similar to that found in [14 In Section 5, we identify the limitations of such an approach, illustrating that an explanation based on recoverable semantic relations cannot provide sufficient nor necessary conditions for the generation of srnixut.",
        "However, the preliminary empirical evaluation we present in Section 4.3 demonstrates that the semantic relation approach provides a useful default that works \"most of the time.\""

        "Compound constructions are also regularly ambiguous.",
        "The various approaches developed to explain the construction of noun compounds and their interpretation can be classified in three groups: semantic, pragmatic, and statistical/lexical.",
        "Semantic theories explain the production of a noun compound Ni N2 as a derivation from a semantic relation Ni R N2 where the relation R is elided.",
        "The theory of recoverably deletable predicates (RDPs) of [12] proposes that only a small set of relations (cause, have, make...) can participate in this process.",
        "Because these relations were too general and sometimes vague, and because one can observe many cases of compounds that do not correspond to any of the proposed RDPs, others have proposed to define more precise domain specific models to explain the deletion of certain relations.",
        "Recognizing the importance of contextual factors, pragmatic theories predict the use of noun compounding when relations like naming or contrast play a role [6].",
        "For example, when referring to two persons wearing a jacket and a coat respectively, one can use compounds like the jacket man and the coat man even though, in neutral contexts, it would be difficult to interpret the same compound (i.e., the wear relation is not deletable).",
        "In [5], the explanation for compounding is provided in the form of lexical/syntactic knowledge.",
        "Generative devices inspired by [14] are found in the lexicon.",
        "In addition, statistical knowledge predicts which derivations are the most likely.",
        "From a generation perspective, the problem is less acute than for interpretation: we must decide whether to construct a compound as opposed to recover the missing relation between the head and the modifier.",
        "The problem has, therefore, not received heavy attention for English generation.",
        "In the past, we used Levi's model in generation [8], but as part of the lexical chooser, and we did not include it within the syntactic realization component.",
