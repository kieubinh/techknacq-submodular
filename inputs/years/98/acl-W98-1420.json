        "Analysis is responsible for representing the input source text in interlingua, and generation produces the target text from those previously constructed representations.",
        "In other Words, the source and the target language are never in direct contact in such systems.",
        "Generation in such systems should at least perform lexical selection, syntactic structure creation, morphological inflection, and word order determination if planning (determination of overall text structure and sentence boundaries) is not considered.",
        "One approach to the design of generation module in interlingua-based MT systems is to handle the first two tasks in a separate architecture, get a form of syntactically represented target sentences, and achieve the last two tasks with a tactical generator.",
        "In this way, only the interlingua dependent tasks are handled in processing interlingua representations.",
        "The aim of this paper is to present a computational architecture for generation which performs the tasks of lexical selection [Dorr, 1993] and syntactic structure determination [Mitamura and Nyberg, 1992] in interlingua approach.",
        "The system is designed to take the interlingua representations of individual sentences and produce their frame-based syntactic representations in which selected lexemes are included [Temizsoy, 1997].",
        "A knowledge-based approach is utilized in the developed architecture such that information about the target language",
        "is taken from knowledge resources.",
        "In other words, its architecture is language-independent.",
        "The utilized interlingua is mainly based on an ontology, a hierarchical world model, to represent propositional content.",
        "It also utilizes special frames to represent semantic and pragmatic phenomena encountered in analysis.",
        "The architecture uses ontology while processing interlingua representation in addition to lexicon, map-rules (relation between interlingua and, target language syntactic structure), and target language's syntax representation formalism.",
