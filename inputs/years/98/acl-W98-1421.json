        "In its first phase (1993 – 1996), a bilingual (English – German) system for time scheduling negotiation dialogues was developed.",
        "For its current second phase (1997 – 2000), a third language, Japanese, has been incorporated.",
        "Additionally, more than two people should be able to participate in the dialogue, a setting we call multi-party.",
        "For the second phase, a novel system feature is currently under development – protocol generation.",
        "The idea is to provide the user(s) with three kinds of protocols: Progress Protocol The most salient parts of the dialogue are summarized.",

        "For the result protocol, a summarization of the goal reached in the negotiation is generated.",
        "The progress protocol serves as a simplified recapitulation of the progress of the dialogue, whereas the status protocol will, on demand, be generated during the ongoing dialogue.",
        "Its task is to deliver a brief description of the current status of the dialogue.",
        "All protocols must be generated in all three languages, putting extra requests on the protocol generation component: particularly, being as language independent as possible.",
