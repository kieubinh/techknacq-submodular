        "The design of Penman is in many respects a systemic functional one (see Matthiessen & Bateman, 1991, for the systemic conception of text generation); that is, the system is based on a theoretical model of language developed within systemic functional linguistics (eg.",
        "Halliday 1994) and Multex shares this base with Penman, drawing on central categories that have been important in text generation such as that of the system network.",
        "Penman includes:",
        "(i) a systemic functional generation grammar, the Nigel grammar, organized around system networks (Matthiessen 1983; cf. also Matthiessen, 1995), (ii) an interface between the grammar and higher-level components (e.g. the knowledge base and the text planner), the chooser & inquiry interface (Matthiessen & Bateman, 1991), (iii) a knowledge base that is organized under the \"Upper Model\" (Matthiessen & Bateman, 1991; cf. also Halliday & Matthiessen, in press) and",
        "(iv) a text planner that is based on RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory, Mann & Thompson, 1988; Hovy, 1993).",
        "The Penman system itself represents the first generation of systems in the Penman tradition; it has been distributed widely and is still being used at various research sites.",
        "It has been used for many generation tasks, eg.",
        "generation in machine translation within the Pangloss project.",
        "Multex can be characterized as a third-generation system within the Penman tradition.",
        "The most notable second-generation system is KPML (Komet-Penman MultiLingual), developed by John Bateman and his group, first at GMD/IPSI in Germany and now at Stirling University, Scotland (see Bateman, 1996).",
        "KPML includes Penman, but it goes considerably beyond the original Penman system, eg.",
        "in its modelling of multilinguality (cf. Bateman et al., 1991).",
        "In addition, KF'ML is equipped with a workbench interface for maintaining and developing its linguistic resources – one of the few or only such tools for generation systems.",

        "• Multex uses a completely different generation algorithm from that of Penman/ICPML.",
        "Chooser-inquiries and system network traversals are absent in Multex.",

        "• Multex uses a modular approach to text generation.",
        "The generation algorithm consists of a plan controller that controls the execution of a number of small content-creation agents, called Meaning Agents.",
        "Each Meaning Agent specialises in generating a particular kind of meaning and modality.",
        "Meaning agents for new specific modalities can be easily integrated into this general planning process.",
        "• Multex plans text in two modes: automatic and cooperative.",
