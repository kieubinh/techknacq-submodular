        "In order to support the efficient development of NL generation systems, two orthogonal methods are currently pursued with emphasis: (1) reusable, general, and linguistically motivated surface realization components, and (2) simple, task-oriented template-based techniques.",
        "Surface realization components impose a layer of intermediate representations that has become fairly standard, such as the Sentence Plan Language (SPL) [Kasper and Whitney, 1989].",
        "This layer allows for the use of existing software with well-defined interfaces, often reducing the development effort for surface realization considerably.",
        "Template-based techniques recently had some sort of revival through several application-oriented projects such as IDAS [Reiter et al., 19951, that combine predefined surface expressions with freely generated text in one or another way.",
        "However, the benefits of both surface realization components and template-based techniques are still limited from an application-oriented perspective.",
        "Surface realization components are difficult to use because of the differences between domain-oriented and linguistically motivated ontologies (as in SPL), and existing template-based techniques are too inflexible.",
        "In this paper we suggest and evaluate flexible shallow methods for report generation applications requiring limited linguistic resources that are adaptable with little effort.",
        "We advise a close connection between domain-motivated and linguistic ontologies, and we suggest a layer of intermediate representation that is oriented towards the domain and the given task.",
        "This layer may contain representations of different granularity, some highly implicit, others very elaborate.",
        "We show how this is used by the processing components in a beneficial way.",
        "The approach suggested does not only change the rnodularization generally assumed for NLG systems drastically, it also renders the system much more application-dependent.",
        "At first glance, however, such an approach seems to abandon generality and reusability completely, but, as we will demonstrate, this is not necessarily the case.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 identifies deficits with current approaches to surface realization that may occur for particular applications.",
        "In Section 3 we propose alternative methods implemented into our sample application, the generation of air-quality reports from current environmental data.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the pros and cons of our approach, and we summarize the conditions for successful use."

        "In language generation a corresponding distinction which we term in-depth vs. shallow generation2 is becoming prominent.",

        "Often such models will turn out to be extremely shallow and simple, but in other cases much more detail is required.",
        "Thus, developing techniques for varying modeling granularity according to the requirements posed by the application is a prerequisite for more custom-tailored systems.",
        "According to Reiter and Mellish, shallow techniques (which they call \"intermediate\") are appropriate as long as corresponding in-depth approaches are poorly understood, less efficient, or more costly to develop [Reiter and Mellish, 1993].",
