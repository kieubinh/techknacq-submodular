        "This paper presents an overview of the GBGen system, a sentence realizer currently developped for French.",
        "The system is strictly deterministic, i.e. it maps semantic structures to surface forms without either simulating parallelism or using backtracking, and the performances are accordingly extremely satisfying.",
        "It is procedural, based on Government & Binding Theory (Chomsky 1981): several levels of syntactic representation are defined, on which configurational searches and transformations apply.",
        "GBGen is large-scale, based on a lexicon of approximately 185.000 entries (more or less 24.000 lexemes together with inflected word forms).",
        "The system covers simple and complex sentences, complex grammatical phenomena like unbounded dependencies, raising and control structures, intrasentential coreference, cliticization, modifiers (both clausal and prepositional) and main cases of coordination.",
        "It also computes several morphosyntactic phenomena like agreement, contractions or pronoun lexicalization.",
        "In what follows, we present the general characteristics of the software and detail its majors components."

        "The input of the generation process is dubbed Pseudo-Semantics.",
        "A pseudo-semantic structure (PSS) contains both lexical and abstract information (whence the term pseudo).",
        "A PSS can be one of the following four semantic objects: CLS, DPS, SLS and CHS.",
        "CLSs (clause structures) represent events and states.",
        "They contain a predicate (usually a verb or an adjective), functional information such as Tense and Aspect, and other PSS objects that participate in the interpretation of the CLS (e.g., elements bearing the thematic roles assigned by the predicate, etc.).",

        "SLSs (Semantic Label Structures) consist of a semantic label/function and an associated PSS.",
        "Roughly, these objects are used to characterize thematic-role bearing elements, modifiers, or the semantic function of adverbs and adjectives.",
        "Finally, CHSs (Characteristic Structures) are used to represent adjectives and adverbs.",
        "All these elements can be combined to obtain the desired semantic representation, but can also be used autonomously (a useful characteristic for the use of pseudo-semantics for machine translation).",

        "Tense is represented through a modified version of Reichenbadi's analysis ([Reichenbach 471), where E is the event time point and S the speech time point, the two points being either equal or ordered with a precedence relation.",
        "Combining Tense with non-lexical aspect (progressive, perfective) leads to verbal tenses.",
        "The other functional information states that the sentence to be generated is a declarative, positive and passive one.",

        "The first one is an SLS with a thematic role Theme and a DPS bearing this role.",

        "Notice, to conclude this section, that the PSSs are not syntactic in nature.",
        "They are unordered, closed dass elements are abstractly represented, and recursiveness in these structures represents no more than minimal semantic scope.",

        "CP is the top node of each sentence and always takes a TP as its complement, which contains tense information and the subject of the clause in most cases (in the example, a passive sentence, the subject is omitted).",
        "VP contains the verb, so-called VP-adverbs in its Spec list, and complements/adjuncts in its Compl list.",
        "In our example, the latter list contains the theme noun phrase and an adjunct (marked with an AdvP), which is the prepositional phrase in this bed.",
        "Nous phrases are formed with an NP, which contains the noun, its complements and adjectives, and a DP, the projection of determiners, which subcategorizes for NPs.",
        "Movement and Binding algorithms apply once the D-structure has been created.",
        "They merely consist in searches in the tree and the movement operation is the generic Move a instruction, familiar to GB practicioners.",
        "In this respect, syntactic processing in the system is configurational.",
        "Going back to our example, the object of the passive verbal form is moved to the first (Spec of) TP with finite T, leaving a coindexed empty category, and the obtained S-structure is the following one:",

        "At present, the system covers a large part of French grammar and deals with complex grammatical phenomena in a highly efficient way.",

        "A tentative orientation to English generation has shown that the system needs only small parametric variations in the procedures to generate major constructions of this language.",
        "Given the promising results of the approach to surface realization we have choosen, we will pursue the development of the GBGen system by extending its grammatical coverage and adding several languages to it."
