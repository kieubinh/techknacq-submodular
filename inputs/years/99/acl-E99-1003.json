        "In the domain of corpus-based terminology two types of tools are currently developed: tools for automatic term extraction (Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996; Brun, 1998) and tools for automatic thesaurus construction (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "These tools are expected to be complementary in the sense that the links and clusters proposed in automatic thesaurus construction can be exploited for structuring the term candidates produced by the automatic term extractors.",
        "In fact, complementarity is difficult because term extractors provide mainly multi-word terms, while tools for automatic thesaurus construction yield clusters of single-word terms.",
        "On the one hand, term extractors focus on multi-word terms for ontological motivations: single-word terms are too polysemous and too generic and it is therefore necessary to provide the user with multi-word terms that represent finer concepts in a domain.",
        "The counterpart of this focus is that automatic term extractors yield important volumes of data that require structuring through a postprocessor.",
        "On the other hand, tools for automatic thesaurus construction focus on single-word terms for practical reasons.",
        "Since they cluster terms through statistical measures of context similarities, these tools exploit recurring situations.",
        "Since single-word terms denote broader concepts than multi-word terms, they appear more frequently in corpora and are therefore more appropriate for statistical clustering.",
        "The contribution of this paper is to propose an integrated platform for computer-aided term extraction and structuring that results from the combination of LEXTER, a Term Extraction tool (Bourigault et al., 1996), and FASTR1, a Term Normalization tool (Jacquemin et al., 1997)."

        "Splitting techniques are used in other shallow parsers such as (Grefenstette, 1992).",
        "In the case of LEXTER, the noun phrases which are isolated by splitting are not intermediary data; they are not used by any other automatic module in order to index or classify documents.",
        "The extracted noun phrases are term candidates which are proposed to the user.",
        "In such a situation, splitting must be performed with high precision.",
        "In order to process correctly some problematic splittings, such as coordinations, attributive past participles and sequences preposition + determiner, the system acquires and uses corpus-based selection restrictions of adjectives and nouns (Bourigault et al., 1996).",
        "For example, in order to disambiguate PP-attachments, the system possesses a corpus-based list of adjectives which accept a prepositional argument built with the preposition a (at).",
        "These selectional restrictions are acquired through Corpus-Based Endogenous Learning (CBEL) as follows: During a first pass, all the adjectives in a predicative position followed by the preposition a are collected.",
