        "In traditional IR methods, this comparison is done based on the use of common index terms in the document and the query (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "The drawback of such methods is that if semantically relevant documents do not contain the same terms as the query, then they will be judged irrelevant by the IR system.",
        "This occurs because the vocabulary that the user uses is often not the same as the one used in documents (Blair and Maron, 1985).",
        "To avoid the above problem, several researchers have suggested the addition of terms which have similar or related meaning to the query, increasing the chances of matching words in relevant documents.",
        "This method is called query expansion.",
        "A thesaurus contains information pertaining to paradigmatic semantic relations such as term synonymy, hypernymy, and hyponymy (Aitchison and Gilchrist, 1987).",

        "The idea underlying this method is that the automatically constructed thesauri can counter all the above drawbacks of WordNet.",
        "For example, as we stated earlier, proper names and their interrelations are not found in WordNet, but if proper names bear some strong relationship with other terms, they often cooccur in documents, as can be modelled by a corpus-based thesaurus.",
        "Polysemous words degrade the precision of information retrieval since all senses of the original query term are considered for expansion.",
