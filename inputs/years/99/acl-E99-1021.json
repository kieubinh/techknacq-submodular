        "The vast majority of the attempts to computer-assisted authorship attribution has been focused on literary texts.",
        "In particular, a lot of attention has been paid to the establishment of the authorship of anonymous or doubtful texts.",
        "A typical paradigm is the case of the Federalist papers twelve of which are of disputed authorship (Mosteller and Wallace, 1984; Holmes and Forsyth, 1995).",
        "Moreover, the lack of a generic and formal definition of the idiosyncratic style of an author has led to the employment of statistical methods (e.g., discriminant analysis, principal components, etc.).",
        "Nowadays, the wealth of text available in the World Wide Web in electronic form for a wide variety of genres and languages, as well as the development of reliable text-processing tools open the way for the solution of the authorship attribution problem as regards real-world text.",
        "The most important approaches to authorship attribution involve lexically based measures.",
        "A lot of style markers have been proposed for measuring the richness of the vocabulary used by the author.",
        "For example, the type-token ratio, the hapax legomena (i.e., once-occurring words), the hapax dislegomena (i.e., twice-occurring words), etc.",
        "There are also functions that make use of these measures such as Yule's K (Yule, 1944), Honore's R (Honore, 1979), etc.",
        "A review of this metrics can be found in (Holmes, 1994).",
        "In (Holmes and Forsyth, 1994) five vocabulary richness functions were used in the framework of a multivariate statistical analysis of the Federalist papers and a principal components analysis was performed.",
        "All the disputed papers lie in the side of James Madison (rather than Alexander Hamilton) in the space of the first two principal components.",
        "However, such measures require the development of large lexicons with specialized information in order to detect the various forms of the lexical units that constitute an author's vocabulary.",
        "For languages with a rich morphology, i.e. Modern Greek, this is an important shortcoming.",
        "Instead of counting how many words occur certain number of times, Burrows (1987) proposed the use of a set of common function (or context-free) word frequencies in the sample text.",
        "This method combined with a principal components analysis achieved remarkable results when applied to a wide variety of authors (Burrows, 1992).",

        "Moreover, all the lexically-based style markers are highly author and language dependent.",
        "The results of a work using such measures, therefore, can not be applied to a different group of authors nor another language.",
        "In order to avoid the problems of lexically-based measures, (Baayen, et al., 1996) proposed the use of syntax-based ones.",
        "This approach is based on the frequencies of the rewrite rules as they appear in a syntactically annotated corpus.",
        "Both high-frequent and low-frequent rewrite rules give accuracy results comparable to lexically-based methods.",
        "However, the computational analysis is considered as a significant limitation of this method since the required syntactic annotation scheme is very complicated and current text-processing tools are not capable of providing automatically such information, especially in the case of unrestricted text.",

        "In this paper, we present an approach to this problem.",
        "In particular, our aim is the discrimination between the texts of various authors of a Modern Greek weekly newspaper.",
        "We use an already existing text processing tool able to detect sentence and chunk boundaries in unrestricted text for the extraction of style markers.",
        "Instead of trying to minimize the computational analysis of the text, we attempt to take advantage of this procedure.",
        "In particular, we use a set of analysis-level style markers, i.e., measures that represent the way in which the text has been processed by the tool.",
        "For example, a useful measure is the percentage of the sample text remaining unanalyzed after the automatic processing.",
        "In other words, we attempt to adapt the set of the style markers to the method used by the sentence and chunk detector in order to analyze the sample text.",
        "The statistical technique of multiple regression is, then, used for extracting a linear combination of the values of the style markers that manages to distinguish the different authors.",
        "The experiments we present, for both author identification and author verification tasks, were performed using real-world text downloaded from the World Wide Web.",

        "The presented approach is fully-automated since it is not based on specialized text preprocessing requiring manual effort.",

        "Regarding the amount of required training data, we proved that ten texts are adequate for representing the stylistic features of an author.",
        "Some experiments we performed using more than ten texts as training corpus for each author did not improved significantly the accuracy results.",
        "It has been also shown that a lower bound of the text-size is 1,000 words.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that this limitation affects mainly authors with vague stylistic characteristics.",
