        "Typed feature grammar constraints that are inexpensive to resolve are dealt with using the top-down interpreter of the ConTroll grammar development system (GOtz and Meurers, 1997b) which uses an advanced search function, an advanced selection function and incorporates a coroutining mechanism which supports delayed interpretation.",
