        "In this paper, we propose a method of detecting Japanese homophone errors in Japanese texts.",
        "Our method is based on a decision list proposed by Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1994; Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "We improve the original decision list by using written words in the default evidence.",
        "The improved decision list can raise the F-measure of error detection.",
        "Most Japanese texts are written using Japanese word processors.",
        "To input a word composed of kanji characters, we first input the phonetic hiragana sequence for the word, and then convert it to the desired kanji sequence.",
        "However, multiple converted kanji sequences are generally produced, and we must then choose the correct kanji sequence.",
        "Therefore, Japanese texts suffer from homophone errors caused by incorrect choices.",
        "Carelessness of choice alone is not the cause of homophone errors; Ignorance of the difference among homophone words is serious.",
        "For example, many Japanese are not aware of the difference between `„#,,Z.'",
        "and ',U.",
        "'s', or between 'AS: and 'LW.",
        "In this paper, we define the term homophone set as a set of words consisting of kanji characters that have the same phone 2.",
        "Then, we define the term homophone word as a word in a homophone set.",
        "For example, the set { 441 (probability), WI (establishment)} is a homophone set because words in the set are composed of kanji characters that have the same phone `ka-ku-ri-tu'.",
        "Thus, and Iii-SL\" are homophone words.",
        "In this paper, we name the problem of choosing the correct word from the homophone set the homophone problem.",
        "In order to detect homophone errors, we make a list of homophone sets in advance, find a homophone word in the text, and then solve the homophone problem for the homophone word.",
        "Many methods of solving the homophone problem have been proposed (Tochinai et al., 1986; Ibuki et al., 1997; Oku and Matsuoka, 1997; Oku, 1994; Wakita and Kaneko, 1996).",
        "However, they are restricted to the homophone problem, that is, they are heuristic methods.",
        "On the other hand, the homophone problem is equivalent to the word sense disambiguation problem if the phone of the homophone word is regarded as the word, and the homophone word as the sense.",
        "Therefore, we can solve the homophone problem by using various \"IV and have a same phone ii-shi'.",
        "The meaning of is a general will, and the meaning of `..f.:AV is a strong positive will.",
        "'AS' and %kV have a same phone (cho-kkan'.",
        "The meaning of ,fte, is an intuition through a feeling, and the meaning of 'AM' is an intuition through a latent knowledge.",
        "2We ignore the difference of accents, stresses and parts of speech.",
        "That is, the homophone set is the set of words having the same expression in hiragana characters.",
        "Proceedings of EACL '99 statistical methods proposed for the word sense disambiguation problem(Fujii, 1998).",
        "Take the case of context-sensitive spelling error detection 3, which is equivalent to the homophone problem.",
        "For that problem, some statistical methods have been applied and succeeded(Golding, 1995; Golding and Schabes, 1996).",
        "Hence, statistical methods are certainly valid for the homophone problem.",
        "In particular, the decision list is valid for the homophone problem(Shinnou, 1998).",
        "The decision list arranges evidences to identify the word sense in the order of strength of identifying the sense.",
        "The word sense is judged by the evidence, with the highest identifying strength, in the context.",
        "Although the homophone problem is equivalent to the word sense disambiguation problem, the former has a distinct difference from the latter.",
        "In the homophone problem, almost all of the answers are given correctly, because almost all of the expressions written in the given text are correct.",
        "It is difficult to decide which is the meaning of `crane', 'crane of animal' or 'crane of tool'.",
        "However, it is almost right that the correct expression of ICA\" in a text is not `iit*' but In the homophone problem, the choice of the written word results in high precision.",
        "We should use this information.",
        "However, the method to always choose the written word is useless for error detection because it doesn't detect errors at all.",
        "The method used for the homophone problem should be evaluated from the precision and the recall of the error detection.",
        "In this paper, we evaluate it by the F-measure to combine the precision and the recall, and use the written word to raise the F-measure of the original decision list.",
        "We use the written word as an evidence of the decision list.",
        "The problem is how much strength to give to that evidence.",
        "If the strength is high, the precision rises but the recall drops.",
        "On the other hand, if the strength is low, the decision list is not improved.",
        "In this paper, we calculate the strength that gives the maximum F-measure in a training corpus.",
