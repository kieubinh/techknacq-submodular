        "In contrast to the aforementioned work in supertag disambiguation, where the objective was to provide a direct comparison between trigram models for part-of-speech tagging and supertagging, in this paper our goal is to improve the performance of supertagging using local techniques which avoid full parsing.",

        "We have introduced two different kinds of models for the task of supertagging.",
        "Contextual models show that features for accurate supertagging only produce improvements when they are appropriately combined.",
        "Among these models were: a one pass head model that reduces propagation of head detection errors of previous models by using supertags themselves to identify heads; a mixed model that combines use of local and long distance information; and a classifier combination model that ameliorates the sparse data problem that is worsened by the introduction of many new features.",
        "These models achieve better supertagging accuracies than previously obtained.",
        "We have also introduced class based models which trade a slight increase in ambiguity for significantly higher accuracy.",
        "Different class based methods are discussed, and the tradeoff between accuracy and ambiguity is demonstrated."
