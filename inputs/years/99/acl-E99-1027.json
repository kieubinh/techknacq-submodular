        "Linguistic analysers are developed for assigning linguistic descriptions to linguistic utterances.",
        "Linguistic descriptions are based on a fixed inventory of descriptors plus their usage principles: in short, a grammatical representation specified by linguists for the specific kind of analysis – e.g. morphological analysis, tagging, syntax, discourse structure – that the program should perform.",
        "Because automatic linguistic analysis generally is a very difficult problem, various methods for evaluating their success have been used.",
        "One such is based on the degree of correctness of the analysis provided, e.g. the percentage of linguistic tokens in the text analysed that receives the appropriate description relative to analyses provided independently of the program by competent linguists ideally not involved in the development of the analyser itself.",
        "Now use of benchmark corpora like this turns out to be problematic because arguments have been made to the effect that linguists themselves make erroneous and inconsistent analyses.",
        "Unintentional mistakes due e.g. to slips of attention are obviously unavoidable, but these errors can largely be identified by the double-blind method: first by having two (or more) linguists analyse the same text independently by using the same grammatical representation, and then identifying differences of analysis by automatically comparing the analysed text versions with each other and finally having the linguists discuss the differences and modify the resulting benchmark corpus accordingly.",
        "Clerical errors should be easily (i.e. consensually) identified as such, but, perhaps surprisingly, many attested differences do not belong to this category.",
        "Opinions may genuinely differ about which of the competing analyses is the correct one, i.e. sometimes the grammatical representation is used inconsistently.",
        "In short, linguistic 'truth' seems to be uncertain in many cases.",
        "Evaluating – or even developing – linguistic analysers seems to be on uncertain ground if the goal of these analysers cannot be satisfactorily specified.",
        "Arguments concerning the magnitude of this problem have been made especially in relation to tagging, the attempt to automatically assign lexically and contextually correct morphological descriptors (tags) to words.",
        "A pessimistic view is taken by Church (1992) who argues that even after negotiations of the kind described above, no consensus can be reached about the correct analysis of several percent of all word tokens in the text.",
        "A more mixed view on the matter is taken by Marcus et al.",
        "(1993) who on the one hand note that in one experiment moderately trained human text annotators made different analyses even after negotiations in over 3% of all words, and on the other hand argue that an expert can do much better.",
        "An optimistic view on the matter has been presented by Eyes and Leech (1993).",
        "Empirical evidence for a high agreement rate is reported by Voutilainen and Jarvinen (1995).",
        "Their results suggest that at least with one grammatical representation, namely the ENGCG tag set (cf. Karlsson et al., eds., 1995), a 100% consistency can be",
        "Proceedings of EACL '99 reached after negotiations at the level of parts of speech (or morphology in this case).",
        "In short, reasonable evidence has been given for the position that at least some tag sets can be applied consistently, i.e. earlier observations about potentially more problematic tag sets should not be taken as predictions about all tag sets."

      "text": [
        "Admittedly Voutilainen and Jarvinen's experiment provides evidence for the possibility that two highly experienced linguists, one of them a developer of the ENGCG tag set, can apply the tag set consistently, at least when compared with each others' performance.",
        "However, the practical significance of their result seems questionable, for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, large-scale corpus annotation by hand is generally a work that is carried out by less experienced linguists, quite typically advanced students hired as project workers.",
        "Voutilainen and Jarvinen's experiment leaves open the question, how consistently the ENGCG tag set can be applied by a less experienced annotator.",
        "Secondly, consider the question of tagger evaluation.",
        "Because tagger developers presumably tend to learn, perhaps partly subconsciously, much about the behaviour, desired or otherwise, of the tagger, it may well be that if the developers also annotate the benchmark corpus used for evaluating the tagger, some of the tagger's misanalyses remain undetected because the tagger developers, due to their subconscious mimicking of their tagger, make the same misanalyses when annotating the benchmark corpus.",
        "So 100% tagging consistency in the benchmark corpus alone does not necessarily suffice for getting an objective view of the tagger's performance.",
        "Subconscious 'bad' habits of this type need to be factored out.",
        "One way to do this is having the benchmark corpus consistently (i.e. with approximately 100% consensus about the correct analysis) analysed by people with no familiarity with the tagger's behaviour in different situations – provided this is possible in the first place.",
        "Another two minor questions left open by Voutilainen and Jarvinen concern the (i) typology of the differences and (ii) the reliability of their experiment.",
        "Concerning the typology of the differences: in Voutilainen and Jarvinen's experiment the linguists negotiated about an initial difference, almost one per cent of all words in the texts.",
        "Though they finally agreed about the correct analysis in almost all these differences, with a slight improvement in the experimental setting a clear categorisation of the initial differences into unintentional mistakes and other, more interesting types, could have been made.",
        "Secondly, the texts used in Voutilainen and Jarvinen's experiment comprised only about 6,000 words.",
        "This is probably enough to give a general indication of the nature of the analysis task with the ENGCG tag set, but a larger data would increase the reliability of the experiment.",
        "In this paper, we address all these three questions.",
        "Two young linguists) with no background in ENGCG tagging were hired for making an elaborated version of the Voutilainen and Jarvinen experiment with a considerably larger corpus.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Next, the ENGCG tag set is described in outline.",
        "Then the training of the new linguists is described, as well as the test data and experimental setting.",

        "2 ENGCG tag set Descriptions of the morphological tags used by the English Constraint Grammar tagger are available in several publications.",
        "Brief descriptions can be found in several recent ACL conference proceedings by Voutilainen and his colleagues (e.g. EACL93, ANLP94, EACL95, ANLP97, ACL-EACL97).",
        "An in-depth description is given in Karlsson et al., eds., 1995 (chapters 3-6).",
        "Here, only a brief sample is given.",

        "For the analysis of unrecognised words, we used EN a rule-based heuristic component that assigns V PAST morphological analyses, one or more, to each word not represented in the lexicon of the system.",

        "2.",
        "Two linguists trained to disambiguate the ENGCG morphological representation (see the subsection on training below) independently marked the correct alternative analyses in the ambiguous input, using mainly structural, but in some structurally unresolvable cases also higher-level, information.",
        "The corpora consisted of continuous text rather than isolated sentences; this made the use of textual knowledge possible in the selection of the correct alternative.",
        "In the rare cases where two analyses were regarded as equally legitimate, both could be marked.",
        "The judges were encouraged to consult the documentation of the grammatical representation.",
        "In addition, both linguists were provided with a checking program to be used after the text was analysed.",
        "The program identifies words left without an analysis, in which case the linguist was to provide the missing analysis.",
        "3.",
        "These analysed versions of the same text were compared to each other using the Unix sdiff program.",
        "For each corpus version, words with a different analysis were marked with a \"RECONSIDER\" symbol.",
        "The \"RECONSIDER\" symbol was also added to a number of other ambiguous words in the corpus.",
        "These additional words were marked in order to 'force' each linguist to think independently about the correct analysis, i.e. to prevent the emergence of the situation where one linguist considers the other to be always right (or wrong) and so 'reconsiders' only in terms of the existing analysis.",
        "The linguists were told that some of the words marked with the \"RECONSIDER\" symbol were analysed differently by them.",

        "7.",
        "The remaining differences in the analyses were jointly examined by the linguists in order to see whether they were due to (i) inattention on the part of one linguist (as a result of which a correct unique analysis was jointly agreed upon), (ii) joint uncertainty about the correct analysis (both linguists feel unsure about the correct analysis), or (iii) conflicting opinions about the correct analysis (both linguists have a strong but different opinion about the correct analysis).",
