        "Telic events are generally viewed as an opposition between a previously holding state and a new one, called a result state (e.g. dead(y) for x kills y).",
        "They trigger a change-of-state (CoS, henceforth), result states (RSs, henceforth) being entailments of CoSs.",
        "Moens and Steedman (1988), Smith (1991), Pustejovsky (1995), and others argue that it is a defining property of telic events.",
        "They should therefore include an `undergoes' argument, whose CoS determines the telicity of the event (i.e., it acts as a measuring-out argument).",
        "Tenny (1987) thus claims that telic events require such an argument, which she calls an affected argument.",
        "Consider for instance John reviewed the paper : as the event reaches its culimation, the affected argument undergoes a CoS (from – ireviewed(paper) to reviewed(paper)), producing a RS.",
        "To put it short, the standard theory of event structure says that telicity implies affectedness (and conversely), and that affectedness implies a CoS/RS (and conversely), associating tightly all those notions.",
        "Jackendoff (1996:309) observed that (implicit) paths such as on the deck in (1) are not affected arguments, so that the telicity of such motion events cannot be explained using affectedness, ruling out a unified affectedness-based account of telicity I.",
        "It follows from this objection that the standard theory should be at least amended.",
        "Jackendoff's solution is a general mapping function from measuring-out arguments (seen as paths) to events.",
        "It is related to incrementality, which I am discussing below."

        "Event-object mapping functions, as proposed in Krifka (1992) and Dowty (1991), are another key approach to the treatment of event structure.",
        "Dowty (1991) calls an incremental theme any argument Yet motion verbs could be attributed an affected argument, i.e., their agents, so that • Jackendoff's point against affectedness does not seem to be decisive.",
        "capable of measuring-out an event.",
        "For instance, the drinking event in (2) can be measured along the quantity of beer contained in the glass through functions mapping the latter onto the former.",
        "(2) John drank a glass of beer.",
        "The glass of beer in (2) undergoes an incremental CoS, and is therefore an incremental theme.",
        "Path-objects (cf. Mary walked the Appalachian trail ; Tenny 1994), can be treated as some special kind of incremental themes, and Jackendoff's solution could thus be reformulated using incrementality2.",
        "Let us turn now to the treatment of so-called achievement verbs (cf. Vendler 1957).",
        "Most authors do not grant them incremental themes.",
        "Dowty (1991), for instance, argues that incremental themes must be able to undergo an incremental CoS :",
        "(3a) ?",
        "?The horse finished crossing the line.",
        "(OK in slow motion) (3b) The horses finished crossing the line.",
        "(3a) shows indeed that cross the line lacks proper subevents, and that no incremental CoS occurs.",
        "But Dowty never considered examples such as (3b), which receive an incremental reading (albeit of a different kind, since the subevents construed in (3) involve individual parts of a set of objects rather than non-individual parts of an individual object, as in (2)).",
        "Therefore, I will conclude that the kind of affected arguments which achievement verbs possess can also be regarded as incremental themes.",
        "It seems at this point that all kinds of telic events can be analysed in terms of incrementality.",
        "However, I will show in the following section that this is not the case.",
        "Generally speaking, relying on incrementality alone would mean relegating CoSs and RSs to the backstage of aspect construal3 : in order to account for telicity without affectedness, one should deny a central role to CoSs, and regard telicity primarily as a matter of measure.",
        "I will propose an alternative solution in the following sections preserving the centrality of CoS, yet departing from the standard",
        "approach to affectedness and CoS, and justified by data falling outside the scope of incrementality.",

        "(6) can be read as telic or atelic, and although its internal argument is undergoing a CoS, it is not an incremental CoS, since the whole of the chicken is gradually affected (and not its subparts ; compare (2)).",
        "It seems rather that the progression of the cooking event depends on the internal structure of the associated RS : the event develops as the chicken is more and more cooked (see Ramchand (1997) for a similar analysis4).",
        "The types of RSs and affectedness involved differ clearly from those of the incremental telic events considered so far.",
        "Such RSs as that of 4 Jackendoff (1996) also proposes RSs as paths for such events.",
        "But the impact on event structure of the difference between the scalar CoS in (6) and the incremental one in (2) cannot be motivated in such works, since it is related to a difference in the associated RSs.",
        "The incrementality approach misses this point, so that RS-based paths are rather ad hoc devices.",
        "cook are scalar, i.e., can vary in terms of degrees (see (7)), so that a 'final' degree may or may not be reached.",
        "Contrariwise, incremental events are not endowed with scalar RSs / affectedness (cf. (8)) : one does not drink something 'to a certain degree / intensity'.",
        "It appears now that a proper treatment of event structure requires a richer conception of RSs, CoSs and affectedness, and cannot be exclusively based on incrementality."

John has been drinking beer) and the latter to its culmination (i.e., to the state of affairs arising from the event's final completion ; cf. John has drunk a beer).",
