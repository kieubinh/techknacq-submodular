        "We started our research with a survey of 19 applied natural language generation (NLG) systems (Paiva, 1998) and noticed that:",
        "• almost all the systems followed a pipeline model; • there was a general agreement on the core NLG tasks that a system should perform (e.g., aggregation, lexicalisation, etc.",
        "); • the surveyed systems mainly differed on the order the NLG tasks are executed (see Cahill et al., 1999);",
        "We also noticed that the texts produced by the various systems were apparently quite different stylistically (although we did not have a formal method to measure how much different they were) and, in order to explain how this variety of texts was obtained with the same type of architecture (i.e., pipeline), we have put forward the hypothesis that the order in which the NLG tasks are executed influences the kind of text that can be obtained, i.e. a certain order would facilitate the generation of a certain type of text whilst another would not.",
        "This hypothesis goes in line with other re-searchers' results which purport to show that architectural aspects of a NLG system depend on the characteristics of the text to be generated and vice versa.",
        "For instance:",
        "• Robin (1994) argues for a revision-incremental architecture for the generation of structurally complex text with floating content – i.e., content that can appear anywhere in the text and is opportunistically realised only if stylistic factors of the surrounding text allow; • Inui and colleagues (1992) conclude that in order to avoid the generation of text with ambiguous and complex sentences a revision architecture is necessary, with the revision module placed at the end of the generation process (i.e., after the linguistic realisation)'; • Reiter (ms.) reports that pipeline architectures cannot deal with constraints on the length of a text.",
        "It is difficult however to reconcile their results in a unified perspective since each of these reported works started with a different perspective and, generally, had different aims in mind.",
        "We believe that it is possible to relate those characteristics of text presented above (such as complexity, ambiguity and sentence length)2 to style,3 and that we can gain insight into NLG architectures having a systematic way to classify texts by their stylistic properties so that we can analyse the architectural aspects in relation to this stylistic classification.",
        "We then start with the point of view that it is reasonable to assume that certain styles of text demand a more specialised type of architecture than others (for example, a revision versus a pipeline architectures) and our idea is to develop a methodology for studying which are the appro",
        "In this figure, one group expresses texts that are formal, concise, and not interactive (text type 1 – a possible example is news column in scientific magazines).",
        "Another group (text type 2) expresses texts that are informal, highly concise, and highly interactive (e.g.. short articles in TV magazines answering readers' questions).",
        "A third one (text type 3) can be considered neither formal nor informal, is not concise and has a medium value for interactiveness.",
        "priate architectures for the generation of texts in a specific style or more than one style.",
        "Hovy (1988) used a similar approach but characterised style in such an informal way that its relation to architectural aspects was compromised; in particular, he could not ensure that he was not missing important relations between style and generator decisions5.",
        "In this paper we will present a characterisation of style and an approach for dealing with it which, we hope, will provide a means to clarify the interaction between the architectures of NLG systems and the type of texts they can, or need to, generate.",
        "The paper continues in the following way: in Section 2 we present the definition of style we are working with and in Section 3 we show how this characterisation will help us to deal with aspects of architecture.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the expected results and, finally, we conclude by presenting where we are in this process.",
        "2 Investigating Style We use the term style to signify the variability in the use of features of a language that can be correlated with certain types of situation – where situation can be regarded \"as the context within which interaction of 'the speech event' occurs\" (Brown and Fraser, 1979; p. 34), involving the participants, the setting and the purposes of the communication.",
        "In order to put this definition to work on our problem, first we need to know how to obtain the set of stylistic parameters, i.e., the parameters that, when varied, will be responsible for producing texts in different styles.",
        "Secondly, we need to find a way to group stylistically-similar texts into sets so that we can study the architec5 \"The specific pragmatic [and stylistic] features used by PAULINE are but a first step.",
        "(...) The strategies PAULINE uses to link its pragmatic [and stylistic] features to the actual generator decisions, being dependerm■R the definitions of the features are equally primitive (Hovy, 1990; p. 193).",
        "tural aspects of each set isolatedly and then try to have a more general view of how style and NLG architectures interact by making a cross-comparison among those isolated analyses.",
        "For the first part, there are two approaches in the literature linking stylistic parameters to characteristics of texts.",
        "We have already cited Hovy (1988) and its main problem: the lack of formality.",
        "DiMarco's (1990) approach was to construct a 'stylistic grammar' using the notion of norm and deviation from norm (see, e.g., Enkvist (1973)).",
        "While this approach is enough to obtain the stylistic parameters6, we think that this characterisation brings a problem for grouping texts into sets – it can create only two sets for studying: the texts that agree with the norm and those that do not.",
        "This can be a problem because, although the texts following the norm will comprise a set of similar texts, those in the 'deviant' set can be so dissimilar that any type of analysis based on them (and, consequently, its interpretation in architectural terms) is probably doomed to failure.",
        "In our approach we will avoid these problems by following a methodology that can provide two things: (1) a characterisation of the stylistic parameters of a corpus', and (2) a partition of a corpus into sets of linguistically similar texts.",
        "We are working with Biber's (1988) methodology.",
        "From a corpus tagged with a comprehensive set of linguistic features of English, we obtain the frequency count associated with each one.8 Using a statistical factor analysis, we group the linguistic features that co-occur, considering each group",
        "a stylistic parameter9 that can then be analysed in functional terms.13 Several stylistic parameters can emerge from a corpus, each text of the corpus having a specific value for each of them (see an example with three stylistic parameters in Figure 1-A).",
        "Our interest in Biber's work is also related to his definition of text types: \"the texts within each type are maximally similar with respect to their linguistic characteristics, while the types are maximally distinct with respect to their linguistic characteristics\" (Biber (1995), p. 10).",
        "In order to obtain the text types, a cluster analysis is used and results in the partitioning of the corpus (i.e., the texts with similar values for all the stylistic parameters will be grouped in a partition (see Figure 1-B)).",
        "Following this procedure will allow us to analyse aspects of architecture for each text type (i.e., each partition) in isolation and, more importantly, make cross-comparisons among these analyses."

        "The set comprises the following tasks: content determination, rhetorical structuring, lexicalisation, intra and inter-sentential ordering, referring expression generation, aggregation, segmentation, and linguistic realisation (for an explanation about those task, see Cahill et al., 1999).",
        "\" Part of the process for relating style to architecture is depicted in Figure 2.",

        "This will give us an idea of which NLG tasks are most responsible for (the linguistic features associated with) the different text types; also, it will show us how the tasks are working (because of the links to the linguistic features (see Figure 2)).",
        "The result of this process will be sets of NLG tasks for each text type.",
        "E.g.:",
        "• passives • conjuncts (e.g., •hoe a/ er, 'in ccmpwisorr, *for example\", ...)",
        "Our work then will be to observe the NLG tasks (inside each text type first, but making cross-comparisons among text types afterwards) attacking the questions related to architecture, i.e., `which kind of modularisation and interaction between modules is necessary/appropriate', `which resources are used', 'what kind of data the modules/tasks exchange', etc.",
        "We will investigate architectural decisions at three different levels:",
        "• at the task level: how can a certain task be made sensitive to values of stylistic parameters?",
        "• at the level of tasks interaction: is there a natural ordering of tasks for a certain type of text?I3 • at the global level: assuming that tasks are normally encapsulated inside modules, what characteristics of texts force the interaction between modules to be more intense?",
        "Faced with this classification we will propose solutions that can be used in the specification of an architecture that supports the generation of texts in different styles.",
        "We expect these solutions to lead to useful guidelines for helping designers of NLG systems to choose the appropriate architecture for the type of text they want their system to generate."
