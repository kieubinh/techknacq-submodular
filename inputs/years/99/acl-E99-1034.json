        "Co-occurrence information, whether it is used for expanding automatically the original query (Qiu and Frei, 1993), for providing a list of candidate terms to the user in interactive query expansion, or for relaxing the independence assumption between query terms (van Rijsbergen, 1977), has been widely used in information retrieval.",
        "Nevertheless, the use of this information has often resulted in reduction of retrieval effectiveness (Smeaton and van Rijsbergen, 1983), a fact sometimes explained by the poor discriminating power of the relationships (Peat and Willet, 1991).",
        "It was not until recently that a more elaborated use of this information resulted in consistent improvement of retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Improvements came from a different computation of the relationships named \"second-order co-occurrence\" (Schütze and Pedersen, 1997), from an adequate combination with other sources of evidence such as relevance feedback (Xu and Croft, 1996), or from a more careful use of the similarities for expanding the query (Qiu and Frei, 1993).",
        "Indeed, interesting patterns relying in co-occurrence information may be discovered and, if used carefully, may enhance retrieval effectiveness.",
        "This paper explores the use of co-occurrence similarities between query terms for determining the subset of query terms which are good descriptors of the user's information need .",
        "Query terms can be divided into those that are useful for retrieval and those that are harmful, which will be named respectively \"content\" terms and \"noisy\" terms.",
        "The hypothesis under examination is that two content terms tend to be more similar to each other than would be two noisy terms, or a noisy and a content term.",
        "Intuitively, the query terms which reflect the user's information need are more likely to be found in relevant documents and should concern similar topic areas.",
        "Consequently, they should be found in similar contexts in the corpus.",
        "A similarity measures the degree to which two terms can be found in the same context, and should be higher for two content terms.",
        "We name this hypothesis the \"Cluster Hypothesis for query terms\", due to its correspondence with the Cluster Hypothesis of information retrieval which assumes that relevant documents \"are more like one another than they are like non-relevant documents\" (van Rijsbergen and SparckJones, 1973, p.252).",
        "Our middle-term objective is to verify experimentally the hypothesis for different types of co-occurrences, different measures of similarity and different collections.",
        "If a higher similarity between content terms is indeed observed, this pattern could be used for tuning the weights of query terms in the absence of relevance feedback information, by increasing the weights of the terms which appear to be content terms, and inversely for noisy terms.",

        "The hypothesis that similarities between query terms is an indicator of the relevance of each term to the user's information need is based on an intuition.",
        "This intuition can be illustrated by the following request: Document will provide totals or specific data on changes to the proven reserve figures for any oil or natural gas producer.",
        "It appears that the only terms which appear in one or more relevant documents are oil,, reserve and gas, which obviously concern similar topic areas, and are good descriptors of the information need 1.",
        "All the other terms retrieve only non-relevant documents, and consequently reduce retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Taken individually, they do not seem to specifically concern the user's information need.",
        "Our hypothesis can be formulated this way:",
        "• Content terms which are representative of the information need (like oil, reserve, and gas) concern similar topics and are more likely to be found in relevant documents; • Terms which concern similar topics should be found in similar contexts of the corpus (documents, sentences, neighboring words...); • Terms found in similar contexts have a high similarity value.",

        "Until now, we have talked of \"content\" or \"noisy\" terms, as terms which are useful or harmful for retrieval.",

        "For terms which occur in one or more relevant documents, the usefulness depends on the total number of relevant documents and on the number of occurrences of the term in the collection.",
        "We use the x2 test of independence between the occurrence of the term and the relevance of a document to determine if the term is a content or a 'Remark that we do not consider here phrases such as 'natural gas', but the argument can be extended to phrases.",
        "noisy term.",
        "For terms which fail the test at the 95% confidence level, the hypothesis of independence is rejected, and they are considered content terms.",
        "Otherwise, they are considered noisy terms.",
        "Another way of verifying if a term is useful for retrieval would be to compare the retrieval efficiency of the query with and without the term.",
        "This method is appealing since our final objective is better retrieval efficiency.",
        "But it has some drawbacks: (1) there are several measures of retrieval effectiveness, and (2) the classification of a term will depend in part on the retrieval system itself.",
        "A point deserves discussion: terms which do not appear in any relevant documents and which are classified noisy may sometimes be significant of the content of the query.",
        "This may happen for example if the number of relevant documents is small and if the vocabularies used in the request and in the relevant documents are different.",
        "Anyway, this does not change the fact that the term is harmful to retrieval.",
        "It could still be used for finding expansion terms, but this is another problem.",
        "In any case, a rough classification of terms between \"content\" and \"noisy\" can always be discussed, the same way that a binary classification of documents between relevant and non-relevant is a major controversy in the field of information retrieval ."

        "Once terms are classified as either content or noisy, three types of term pairs are considered: content-content, content-noisy, and noisy-noisy.",

        "However, it would be interesting to see if techniques developed for word sense disambiguation such as (Yarowsky, 1992) could be adapted to determine the usefulness of a query term for retrieval.",
        "From our preliminary investigations, it seems that similarities can be used as positive and as negative evidence that a term should be useful for retrieval.",
        "The other part of our work is to determine a technique for using this pattern in order to improve term weighting, and at the end improve retrieval effectiveness.",
        "While simple techniques might work and will be tried (e.g. clustering), we seriously doubt about it because every relationship between query terms should be taken into account, and this leads to very complex interactions.",
        "We are presently developing a model where the probability of the state (content/noisy) of a term is determined by uncertain inference, using a technique for representing and handling uncertainty named Probabilistic Argumentation Systems (Kohlas and Haenni, 1996).",
        "In the next future, this model will be implemented and tested against simpler models.",
        "If the model allows to predict reasonably well the state of each query term, this information can be used to refine the weighting of query terms and lead to better information retrieval."
