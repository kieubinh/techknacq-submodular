        "In the context of spoken task-oriented man-machine and question-answering dialogues, one of the most important problem is to deal with spontaneous and unexpected syntactical phenomena.",
        "Utterances can be very incomplete and difficult to predict which questions the principle of grammaticality.",
        "Moreover large covering grammars are generally dedicated to written text parsing and it is not easy to exploit such a grammar for the analysis of spoken language even if complex syntax does not occur.",
        "For such sentences, robust parsing techniques are necessary to extract a maximum of information from the utterance even if a complete parsing fails (at least all possible constituents).",
        "Considering parsing of word-graphs and the large search space of parsing algorithms in order to compute all possible ambiguities, the number of partial parses can be very important.",
        "A robust semantic processing on these partial derivations would result in a prohibitive number of hypotheses.",
        "We argue in this paper that appropriate syntactical constraints expressed in a Lexicalized Tree Grammar (LTG) can trigger efficient repair rules for specific oral phenomena.",
        "First results of a classical grammatical parsing are presented, they show that robust parsing need to cope with oral phenomena.",
        "We argue then that extended domain of locality and lexicalization of LTG can be exploited in order to express repair local rules for these specific spoken phenomena.",
        "First results of this approach are presented."

        "We used a bottom-up parser (Lopez, 1998b) for LTAG.",
        "The size of the grammar was limited compared with (Candito, 1999) and corresponds to the sublanguage used in the Gocad application.",
        "However designing principles of the grammar was close to the large covering French LTAG grammar just including additional elementary trees (for example for unexpected adverbs which can modify predicative nouns) and a notation enrichment for the possible ellipsis occurrences (Lopez, 1998a).",
        "The LTAG grammar for the sublanguage corresponds to a syntactical lexicon of 529 entries and a set of 80 non-instancied elementary trees.",
        "A taxonomy of parsing errors occurring in oral dialogue shows that the majority of failures are linked to orality: hesitations, repetitions, self repairs and some head ellipsis.",
        "The table 2 gives the occurrence of these oral phenomena in the Gocad corpora.",
        "Of course more than one phenomenon can occur in the same utterance.",
