        "In the context of the global research effort to map the human genome, the Genome Informatics Extraction project, GENIA (GENIA, 1999), aims to support such research by automatically extracting information from biochemical papers and their abstracts such as those available from MEDLINE (MEDLINE, 1999) written by domain specialists.",

        "This project aims to help reduce the problems caused by information overload on the researchers who want to access the information held inside collections such as MEDLINE.",
        "The key elements of the project are centered around the tasks of information extraction and retrieval.",
        "These are outlined below and then the interface which integrates them is described."

      "text": [
        "Through discussions with domain experts, we have identified several classes of useful entities such as the names of proteins and genes.",
        "The reliable identification and acquisition of such class members is one of our key goals so that terminology databases can be automatically extended.",
        "We should not however underestimate the difficulty of this task as the naming conventions in this field are very loose.",
        "In our initial experiments we used the EN-GCG shallow parser (Voutilainen, 1996) to identify noun phrases and classify them as proteins (Sekimizu et al., 1998) according to their cooc-currence with a set of verbs.",
        "Due to the difficulties caused by inconsistent naming of terms, we have decided to use multiple sources of evidence for classifying terminology.",
        "Currently we have extended our approach and are exploring two models for named entity recognition.",
        "The first is based on a statistical model of word clustering (Baker and McCallum, 1998) which is trained on pre-classified word lists from Swissprot and other databases.",
        "We supplemented this with short word lists to identify the class from a term's final noun if it existed in a head final position.",
        "In our first experiments on a judgement set of 80 expert tagged MEDLINE abstracts the model yielded F-scores for pre-identified phrases as follows: 69.35 for 1372 source entities, 53.00 for 3280 proteins, 66.67 for 56 RNA and 45.20 for 566 DNA: We expect this to improve with the addition of better training word lists.",
        "The second approach is based on decision trees (Quinlan, 1993), supplemented with word lists for classes derived from Swissprot and other databases.",
        "In these tests the phrases for terms were not pre-identified.",
        "The model was trained on a corpus of 60 expert tagged MEDLINE abstracts and tested on a corpus of 20 articles yielding F-scores of: 55.38 for 356 source, 66.58 for 808 protein entities.",
        "The number of RNA",
        "Proceedings of EACL '99 and DNA entities was too small to train with.",
        "As part of the overall project we are creating an expert-tagged corpus of MEDLINE abstracts and full papers for training and testing our tools.",
        "The markup scheme for this corpus is being developed in cooperation with groups of biologists and is based on a conceptual domain model implemented in SGML.",
        "The corpus itself will be cross-validated with an independent group of biologists."

        "One part of this work is the construction and maintenance of an ontology for the domain which is executed by a system which we are now developing called Ontology Extraction-Maintenace System (OEMS).",
        "OEMS extracts three types of information about the domain-ontology, (Ogata, 1997), called typing information, from the abstracts: taxonomy (a subtype structure), mereology (a part-whole structure), synonymy (an identity structure).",
        "Eventually we hope to be able to identify and extract domain specific facts such as protein-protein binding information from full texts and to aid biochemists in the formation of cell signalling diagrams which are necessary for their work."
