        "In a typical expert-consultation dialogue, one participant (hereafter referred to as the executing agent or EA) has a goal that hel wants to achieve and is working with the other participant (referred to as the consulting agent or CA) to construct a plan for achieving this goal.",
        "Although both the plan construction process and the conversation are collaborative activities, this does not mean that people always believe what they are told.",
        "In fact, part of the collaborative activity of conversation is negotiation of conflicting beliefs.",
        "This negotiation is particularly important in task-oriented expert-consultation dialogues, since the participants must resolve any conflicting beliefs in order to work together effectively to devise a plan that is both well-formed and addresses the executing agent's needs.",
        "Thus, a robust natural language consultation system must be able to handle negotiation subdialogues.",
        "Even though there is wide agreement that negotiation is an integral part of multi-agent activity, previous natural language understanding systems have been unable to handle negotiation subdialogues such as the following:",
        "(1) Si: Who is teaching CS360?",
        "(2) S2: Dr. Smith is teaching CS360.",
        "(3) Si: But isn't CS360 an undergraduate course?",

        "CS360 is an undergraduate course.",
        "(5) Dr. Smith teaches both graduate and undergraduate courses.",
        "(6) Si: Who handles the CS360 lab?",
        "For example, existing systems do not recognize when an agent is expressing doubt at a previous response as in utterance (3), when an agent is attempting to resolve a conflict suggested by the other participant as in utterances (4)-(5), or when an agent is implicitly conveying acceptance of a communicated proposition as in utterance (6).",
        "These shortcomings prevent existing natural language systems from being able to handle dialogues in which one agent initially does not accept the proposition conveyed by the other agent and initiates a negotiation subdialogue to resolve their differences in belief.",
        "We have developed a plan-based model of dialogue that addresses these limitations.",
        "Our analysis of naturally occurring dialogue indicates that one way that people express doubt at a proposition P doubt is by contending that some other conflicting proposition P, is true.",
        "Our process model includes an algorithm for recognizing such expressions of doubt, as well as other complex discourse acts.",
        "The algorithm uses a multistrength belief model and a combination of linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge.",
        "Our implemented system can recognize implicit as well as explicit acceptance of a communicated proposition, multiple expressions of doubt at the same proposition, expressions of doubt at both immediately preceding and earlier utterances, and negotiation subdialogues embedded within other negotiation subdialogues.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we describe our system and how this process is performed.",

        "First it discusses why it is necessary to capture varying degrees of belief, describes the multistrength model of belief used in our system, and discusses how our description of actions avoids assuming that a speaker will automatically adopt a communicated proposition.",
        "Then it introduces the notion of an action that requires evidence for its recognition and presents our recognition algorithm that uses a combination of linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge.",

        "These utterances were often realized as an elliptical fragment and included \"And you're how old?\", \"Even though it's four more years?\", and \"At my age?\" • Drawing attention to violated expectations: The speaker mentions an expectation that is inconsistent with the doubted proposition.",

        "Our current system does not handle such expressions of doubt.",
        "• Repetition: The speaker queries the doubted proposition; this usually took the form of a declarative followed by a question mark, as in \"You have 40 thou(sand) in a mm fund?\" • Explicit statements and questions: The speaker explicitly doubts what has been said or asks for justification; examples from our corpus include \"I'm not so sure of that.\" and \"Who ever said that?\" • Cue words: The speaker uses discourse markers to convey his doubt.",

In this way, our system is able to handle instances in which an utterance of the form \"Isn't Pi?\" is used to request verification (since the utterance is viewed as conveying uncertainty about Pi) as well as instances in which it is used to express doubt (since the utterance is viewed as conveying some belief in Pi).",
        "Our multistrength belief model maintains three degrees of belief: certain belief (a belief strength of C); strong but uncertain belief, as in \"Isn't Dr. Brown teaching Architecture?\" (a belief strength of S); and weak belief, as in \"I think that Dr. Cayne might be an education instructor\" (a belief strength of W).",
        "Three degrees of disbelief (indicated by attaching a subscript of N, such as SN to represent strong disbelief and WN to represent weak disbelief) are also maintained, and one degree indicating no belief about a proposition (a belief strength of 0).",
        "We adopted three degrees of positive and negative belief in our model because that was the minimum number of degrees required for modeling the beliefs communicated in the dialogues that we examined and in the negotiation subdialogues that our system is intended to handle.",

        "to bound it – for example, he may be able to say that the first agent has some belief in a proposition.",
        "Our belief model uses belief intervals to capture this, where a belief interval specifies the range of strengths within which an agent's beliefs are thought to fall.",
        "Allen and Perrault (1980) noted the need to represent an agent's wanting to know the referent of a term in a proposition, without having to specify what that referent was.",
        "For example, if EA asks CA \"Who is teaching CS360?\", we cannot represent CA's belief that EA wants to know the teacher of CS360 as • believe(CA, want(EA, believe(EA, Teaches(Dr.Smith, CS360))))",
        "believe(CA, want(EA, knowref(EA, Jac, Teaches(_fac, C5360)))) In our multistrength belief model, knowref is treated as being certain about the referent of the term in the specified proposition and knowif is treated as being certain about whether a proposition is true or false.",
        "As the dialogue progresses, the belief model must capture the changing beliefs of the user.",
        "When a discourse act has been successful, its goals can be used to update the belief model.",
        "For example, if the user explicitly accepts the proposition conveyed by the utterance \"Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture\" (perhaps by saying \"Yes, I'll accept that\"), then the system can update its belief model to include the belief that the user himself believes that Dr. Smith is teaching Architecture.",
        "However, explicit acceptance is less common than implicit acceptance; Section 4.6 discusses implicit acceptance and its recognition.",
        "Since we do not currently have a response generation component, our system processes the utterances of both participants, alternating between playing the role of CA and the role of EA.",
        "Note that this differs from playing the role of a third-party observer – when the system plays the role of EA, the system has access to EA's beliefs (including EA's beliefs about the current dialogue model and EA's beliefs about CA), and when the system plays the role of CA, it has access to CA's beliefs.",

        "Although this system provides needed differentiation among beliefs that the system knows the user holds, those that the system has attributed to the user, and those about which the system has no knowledge, this model still does not contain degrees of partial belief that are essential for modeling discourse acts such as expressing doubt.",

        "She uses endorsements (Cohen 1985) in an assumption-based truth maintenance system (AIMS [DeKleer 1986]) to specify a system that orders beliefs according to how strongly they are held.",

        "That is, cooperative listeners often provide some evidence to speakers to indicate that the listener believes the speaker's claims.",

        "Some of our discourse recipes, such as Obtain-Info-Ref, include subactions by both the initiating agent and the other participant.",
        "This captures the intention of the initiating agent to perform his required subactions as well as the intention that the other agent follow through on her role in the plan for this action.",
        "Thus, once the second agent recognizes that the initiating agent wants to obtain information, the second agent will also recognize that the initiating agent intends for her to play the role of providing that information.",

        "He postulated a Convince act that would cause the hearer to believe the proposition, but this act was left undeveloped and its definition did not allow for the participants to negotiate their beliefs.",
        "The effect of an Inform act in Allen and Perrault's system (Allen and Perrault 1980) is that the hearer believes the communicated proposition – this definition would seem to say that the hearer always accepts the information provided by the speaker.'",
        "Although Allen and Perrault's model was only concerned with recognizing the intention to perform an Inform act, using his formulation to model negotiation dialogues (where Inform actions may not automatically accomplish their purpose) is problematic.",
        "In Perrault's (1990) persistence model of belief, the hearer adopts a communicated proposition unless he has evidence to the contrary, in which case his original belief persists.",
        "Thus, models such as Allen and Perrault's cannot account for a hearer who does not accept a communicated proposition, and Perrault's model cannot account for a hearer who changes his beliefs about a proposition after negotiation.",
        "We want to overcome these limitations and be able to handle negotiation subdialogues in which participants attempt to come to some agreement about their disparate beliefs.",
        "Thus, the body of the recipe for our Inform act (Figure 3) contains two subactions: one in which the speaker tells the hearer a proposition and a second in which the participants address the believability of the communicated proposition and try to come to agreement.",
        "In addition, as discussed in the preceding section, the effects of our discourse recipes are often different from the goals.",
        "Although this does not solve the problem of recognizing perlocutionary effects, it does allow us to capture the notion that one can, for example, perform an Inform act without the hearer adopting the communicated proposition.",
        "Thus, the goal of a discourse recipe is a desired perlocutionary effect (an effect that the speaker wishes the action to have, e.g., believe (hearer, P, [C: C] ) in the case of an Inform action), and the effects of a discourse recipe are the illocutionary effects (that is, the effect that the speech act has when it is performed and recognized by the hearer, e.g., believe (hearer , want (speaker , believe (hearer , P, [C : C] ) ) , IC : C] ) in the case of an Inform action).",

        "(Pollack's example of incoherence is the query \"I want to talk to Kathy, so I need to find out how to stand on my head.\") In our model we look for evidence of incompatibility, and in our implemented system this evidence takes the form of stereotypical beliefs about the domain.",
        "While our implementation does not include other means of deducing an incompatibility, they are not precluded by our theory but are left for future work.",

        "Our stereotypical beliefs fall into this category.",
        "In other cases, the clue word but causes the listener to accommodate a belief about incompatibility that he might not otherwise have done and thereby recognize the expression of doubt.",

        "When the subjects did not interpret the utterance as an expression of doubt (see below), five of them contended that a better interpretation would be that EA was seeking verification of the queried proposition.",
        "Since our system already recognizes from the surface negative question that the speaker has a strong (but uncertain) belief in the queried proposition, it is easy to extend our system so that it can explicitly identify a Seek-Verification discourse act.",
        "The other category for which there was disagreement was surface negative questions where a clue word was not present and the stereotypical domain knowledge did not provide a conflict.",

        "However, it should be noted that our subjects were split on how these problematic cases should be interpreted, agreeing with the system's interpretation slightly more than half the time.",
        "There was also another such surface negative question where one subject viewed the system's interpretation as reasonable but argued that an expression of doubt would be a better interpretation.",

        "However, it is unclear whether a speaker would expect a listener to recognize such utterances as expressions of doubt without additional clues.",

        "This should aid in extending the kinds of discourse acts that can be handled.",
        "Although transporting our system to another domain will require encoding new domain knowledge and new domain recipes, the recipes for discourse and problem-solving acts are domain-independent and thus will remain unchanged.",
