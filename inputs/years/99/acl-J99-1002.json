In general, although there have been several approaches to formalizing default inheritance within feature structure languages by defining an operation of default unification (some examples are cited in Section 1.2), these have failed to achieve the combination of perspicuity, declarativity, and expressibility familiar from unification-based approaches to nondefault inheritance.",

        "We intend our representation language to supplement rather than supplant existing work using monotonic inheritance within frameworks such as HPSG.",
        "Nondefault processing is crucial to parsing and generation in a unification-based framework, because unification failure is required to prevent ungrammatical structures.",
        "From this perspective, it seems reasonable to expect grammars and lexicons to have a monotonic backbone, which encodes the main architectural properties of the feature structures.",
        "Since construction of grammars and lexicons is error-prone, we believe that grammar writers will want to prevent accidental overriding of such structural information by ensuring that it is indefeasible.",
        "We therefore believe that it is desirable that defaults be explicitly marked, and, as shown by Young and Rounds (1993), this is a necessary condition for the order-independence of default unification (criterion 5, below).",

        "information.",
        "The usual assumption about conflicting defaults is that they do not result in an inconsistent knowledge state (e.g., Reiter 1980).",
        "So, it is clearly desirable that unification failure does not occur as a side effect of the way default information is defined.",
        "3.",
        "Default unification behaves like monotonic unification in the cases where",
        "monotonic unification would succeed.",
        "We want to use the same notions of unification, subsumption, etc.",

        "4.",
        "Default unification returns a single result, deterministically.",
        "As we will describe in Section 3, there are definitions of default unification in which a disjunction of feature structures may be produced.",
        "While there is nothing wrong with such definitions formally, they are practically inconvenient, since they can result in a multiplication of structures, and they are only suitable for implementations that allow disjunction.",
        "5.",
        "Default unification can be described using a binary, order-independent (i.e., commutative and associative) operation.",
        "The main failing of most definitions of default unification is that they are not order-independent.",
        "Having an order-dependent operation in the",
        "description language is inelegant, but it has been regarded as acceptable, because all the structures to be unified are in a fixed hierarchy and an inheritance order can therefore be imposed (there will be a difference between top-down vs. bottom-up inheritance, for instance).",
        "However, order dependence undermines many of the arguments in favor of constraint-based grammar formalisms: that is, that processing can be seen as a uniform accumulation of constraints and is independent of the algorithm that controls evaluation order.",
        "For instance, an order-dependent operation causes problems for strategies such as lazy evaluation.",
        "More fundamentally, we have argued (e.g., in Lascarides and Copestake, in press) that it is necessary for the lexicon to propose default information that may be overridden by pragmatics.",
        "In a discourse situation, however, it is impossible to predict which pieces of information are to be unified in advance of starting the discourse parsing process, so the interface between discourse processing and order-dependent lexical processing would have to take into account the order in which the unification operations are done, which is impractical."

        "PDU thus meets criterion 6 for nonreentrant information, but it can't validate the overriding of default reentrancy by conflicting default values introduced by a more specific type.",
        "This is partly because the logic underlying PDU demands that the default values on paths are worked out independently of one another.",
        "Since PDU can't compare values on paths that, by default, share nodes, we were forced to make the design decision that default reentrancies always survive, and if the default values on the shared node that are introduced by a more specific type conflict, then the value on the shared node in the result is 1, indicating unification failure.",

        "The type that labels an atomic FS in a tail serves to prioritize the default information given by the atomic FS – the priority being determined by the position of this type in the type hierarchy (more specific types have higher priority).",

        "(1996), we used a tripartite structure consisting of an indefeasible typed feature structure, a defeasible TFS and the tail, written in a slashed notation: Indefeasible/Defeasible/Tail.",
        "The full PDU-style representation corresponding to Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2 (the atomic FSs shown here are notationally equivalent to the path:value pairs used in Lascarides et al.).",
        "Note that in Figure 2 the tails do not contain all the default information; in particular, they contain only path value structures, and do not contain equalities on paths (i.e., reentrancies).",
        "This contributed to PDU failing to achieve all the criteria mentioned in Section 1.1.",
        "YADU is different from PDU, in that it will achieve these criteria.",
        "In contrast, the tails in YADU contain information about reentrancy.",
        "This means that, unlike in PDU, it is not necessary to maintain the defeasible TFS as a substructure in the representation, since it can be calculated directly from the indefeasible structure and the tail.",
        "Thus for YADU we use bipartite structures, which we write Indefeasible/Tail.",
        "We will refer to these as typed default feature structures (TDFSs).",
        "The YADU representations corresponding to Figure 2 are shown in Figure 3.",
        "There are two operations in YARU: one involves combining two TDFSs to form another TDFS, which we will notate Ii, and another takes a TDFS and returns a TFS, as discussed below.",
        "n corresponds to unifying the indefeasible TFSs of the input TDFSs using the normal definition of typed unification, and taking the set union of their tails, with removal of elements that are inconsistent with the combined indefeasible structure.",

        "Note that the tails may contain conflicting information.",
        "In general, for any operation that makes use of default information, we want to know which elements in the tail \"win.\"",
        "We therefore also define an operation on a TDFS, DefF'S, which returns a",
        "TDFSs and default structures after inheritance using YADU.",
        "single default TFS (corresponding to the default structure in PDU).",
        "The default structures corresponding to the TDFSs are shown in the right-hand column in Figure 4.",
        "A default TFS is calculated from a TDFS by unifying in the maximal set of compatible elements of the union of the tails to the nondefault TFS in priority order.",
        "In this case, the priority order is given by the ordering in the type hierarchy, that is pst-t-verb is strictly more specific than regverb, which is strictly more specific than verb.",
        "In the case where there are no conflicts in the tail, this straightforwardly amounts to the unification of the atomic FSs in the tail, as in the structures shown for verb and regverb in Figure 4.",
        "For pst-t-verb, the intermediate results of successively unifying in the tail elements according to their specificity ordering are shown below.",
        "Thus the conflict between the information on regverb and pst-t-verb is resolved in the favor of the latter, since it is more specific.",
        "This is the reason for separating verb and reg-verb in the example above, since we want the +t value to override the +ed information on regverb while leaving intact the default reentrancy which was specified on verb.",
        "If we had not done this, there would have been a conflict between the defaults that was not resolved by priority.",
        "In such cases, we take the generalization of the competing defaults, but for simplicity we leave the details to Section 3, where the definition of YADU is given.",
        "Note that in examples such as this one, defaults are being used to capture lexical generalizations, but the suffixes seen by the morphological analyzer must be nonde-feasible, otherwise incorrect strings such as sleeped would be accepted, because the default +t could be overridden.",
        "We refer to such defaults as nonpersistent since the tails of the TDFSs must be incorporated into the indefeasible structure at the interface between the lexicon and the rest of the system.",
        "This is the analogue of the operation called DefFill in Lascarides et al.",
        "(1996), but, in contrast to PDU, YADU DefF'ill simply amounts to taking the defeasible structure, constructed as described above, since this is guaranteed to be a valid TFS that is more specific than the indefeasible structure.",
        "For our purposes, it is convenient to define DefF'ill as returning a TDFS with an empty tail (see Section 3.3 and Section 4).",
        "For instance:",
        "It will be apparent that the tail notation for TDFSs can become quite cumbersome.",
        "For cases where there are no conflicts in the tails and where the priority order corresponds to the type of the indefeasible TFS, we can use the slash notation that we initially introduced in Figure 1.",
        "This notation can be used as a shorthand for the description of type constraints, and in fact it is generally convenient to use it in the description language, rather than to specify tails individually.",
        "We will formalize the relationship between the abbreviatory notation and the full TDFSs in Section 3, and use it when discussing examples where possible.",
        "Before concluding this section, we should note that there is a contrast in behavior between the PDU and YADU operation, in that with YADU a default value could override a default reentrancy, which was not possible in the earlier work.",
        "The reason for making the reentrancy between PAST and PASSP default on verb was that these forms differ in some classes of irregular verbs (e.g., speak, spoke, spoken).",
        "In PDU, the default reentrancy could only have been overridden by a nondefault value.",
        "Arguably however, the specification of the vowel change and suffixation for this class ought also to be defeasible, because of a subclass of these verbs, such as weave, which are also found with the regular suffixation pattern (wove/ weaved, woven/weaved) (cf. Russell et al.",

        "One interesting point is that the specification language discussed in Section 3.5 allows for a very succinct encoding of constraints which, like the valence principle, state that a set of features are identical by default.",
        "Figure 15 shows this alternative encoding for VALP: the default TFS states one coindexation, between the VAL features for mother and head daughter.",
        "Because the definition of BasicTDFS states that a path equivalence will be present in the tail for each case where a node can be reached by two distinct paths, the TDFS contains tail elements indicating a path equivalence not only for VAL, but also for all paths that extend VAL, i.e., SUBJ, COMPS, and SPR (for clarity, we have shown the type list explicitly, rather than using the angle-bracket notation: list has no appropriate features).",
        "Thus the TDFS has one extra tail element compared to the version we gave in Figure 12, but this extra element will be overridden in all of the schemata (except head-zero-comp-phrase, if we use the encoding assumed in Figure 13).8 Thus the use of defaults allows a more concise specification of the phrase hierarchy, enabling generalizations to be captured that would be obscured with a purely monotonic treatment.",
        "Although these constraints could be captured in a system without defaults, either they would have to be stipulated redundantly, in multiple points in the hierarchy, or extra types would have to be introduced so that multiple inheritance could be used to distribute properties appropriately.",

        "When discussing the complexity properties of YADU, we have to distinguish between the n operation, which involves the combination of two TDFSs, and DefFS, the calculation of the default structure from a TDFS.",
        "One reason for drawing this distinction is that, in a practical system, it may be necessary to carry out the former operation much more frequently than the latter.",
        "As we mentioned in Section 3, it is only necessary to construct the default feature structure at some interface: for example, at the interface between the lexicon and the parser/generator (as in the examples in Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3) or between the grammar and the pragmatic component (as in the examples in Section 4.4).",
        "In fact, only one DefFS operation is necessary per lexical entry (or other grammar object), regardless of the depth or complexity of the inheritance hierarchy.",
        "Similarly, one DefFS is required per parse for the use of persistant defaults.",
        "This is fortunate, since the combination operation has considerably better complexity properties than the calculation of the default structure.",
        "H> simply involves unification of typed feature structures, set union of tails, and removal of tail elements that are incompatible with the indefeasible structure.",
        "Checking path-value tail elements for unifiability with the indefeasible structure involves checking one pair of types to see if they are compatible.",
        "Checking path-equivalence elements is roughly equivalent to unifying the relevant parts of the indefeasible structure: in the worst case this could amount to unifying two TFSs of (n – 1)/2 nodes each per tail-element, where n is the number of nodes in the indefeasible structure.",
        "But, although we defined 11 as requiring the elimination of tail elements that are incompatible with the default, we could equivalently have left this to the DefFS operation, and simply accumulated tail elements via set union.",
        "This is an insignificant overhead on normal unification, since the tail elements have very simple structures.",
        "In contrast, the worst-case properties of the calculation of the default TFS are unpleasant.",
        "Recall that this operation involves partitioning the tail and then carrying out a step similar to asymmetric default unification as described by Carpenter (1993) for each partition.",
        "The only known algorithms for computing asymmetric default unification are factorial in the number of atomic FSs in the worst case (Carpenter 1993).",
        "Thus, for a partition with t tail elements, the worst-case performance is proportional to t!",
        "in the number of individual unification operations, where each unifcation could involve up to (n – 1)/2 nodes, as above.",
        "In practice, YADU is much better behaved on realistic examples than this would suggest.",
        "The first point to make is that, as far as operations on TFSs themselves are concerned, the DefFS operation can be implemented as a series of normal unification steps.",
        "One consequence of this is that the use of YADU does not incur any significant overhead with respect to ordinary unification when there are no tail elements.",
        "The only additional requirement for YADU is that there be a slot at the top level of an object's representation to store its tail.",
        "We mention this because it contrasts with some other extensions to IFS formalisms: implementations of disjunction, for example, generally require that the TFS data structures and unification algorithms be considerably more complex, with a consequent overhead in performance even for nondisjunctive structures.",
        "Another mitigating factor is that it is easy for a grammar writer to tell in advance whether a particular use of defaults is likely to be computationally expensive.",
        "The worst-case complexity behavior only occurs in situations where there are interactions between path equivalence statements that are not resolved by specificity.",
        "While it is possible to invent pathological examples that have very deleterious performance characteristics, it is not clear that comparable cases will often arise in real grammars, especially if defaults are being used in a rather conservative fashion to extend a mono",
        "tonic core grammar.",
        "Consider the example in Section 4.1, for instance.",
        "There is only a single path value element in the tails of any of the structures described, and this will straightforwardly either conflict or be compatible with an indefeasible atomic value.",
        "Indeed in examples like this, the reduction in the numbers of types involved compared to the purely monotonic encoding could potentially lead to an efficiency gain.",
        "As we mentioned above, since PDU is polynomial, it has much better worst-case behavior than YADU.",
        "However, making a realistic comparison is not straightforward.",
        "The combination operation in PDU is more complex than in YADU, since it is necessary to calculate default TFSs at every stage as well as tails.",
        "The constant overhead compared to ordinary unification is higher and the implementation of PDU is trickier than YADU.",
        "Furthermore, there is a trade-off between complexity behavior and intuitiveness.",
        "The reason that PDU has better complexity behavior is that it always accumulates default reentrancies.",
        "If there is a clash with default values, the default reentrancies win – if there is a clash with indefeasible values, the coindexed nodes in the default structure are set to 1, indicating inconsistency, and the DefFill operation must subsequently take care of constructing a valid TFS by removing the default path equivalences.",
        "However, this can lead to cases where potentially valid default path equivalences are removed.",
        "Thus, in PDU the sort of example that leads to the factorial worst-case complexity in YADU is treated specially, in that maximal information is not incorporated from the default structure.",
        "Roughly speaking, for these corner cases, there is a trade-off between the complexity behavior in YADU, and the complex behavior of PDU.11 But our main practical reason for preferring YADU over PDU is that PDU can behave in unintuitive ways in examples where YADU would have nonproblematic complexity behavior.",

This would give a finer-grained notion of maximal incorporation of information, since there might be a situation where t was incompatible with a type u in the nondefault FS (or it was incompatible with a more specific default FS) but where un w resulted in some more specific type v, which would survive in the YADU result (see Figure 23).",

        "ena suggest that there are conventional default constraints that persist beyond the lexicon, and are potentially overridden by more open-ended reasoning with (default) pragmatic knowledge in a discourse context.",
        "This requires a definition of default unification where the default results of unification are marked as default, and thus distinguished from the indefeasible results.",
        "We provided a definition of default unification known as YADU, which intuitively models the incorporation of the maximal amount of default information into the result, by adapting Carpenter's (1993) version of asymmetric default unification to the situation where default and nondefault information is distinguished in a single structure and defaults may have different priorities.",
        "Our definition was formally proven to meet the above requirements.",
        "We suggested that such a definition of default unification can improve the declarativity of existing uses of default inheritance within the lexicon because it does not require one to pre-specify the order in which information is to be accumulated.",
        "Despite YADU's factorial worst-case complexity behavior, its use does not significantly decrease overall system performance when compared to a monotonic encoding for the examples we have tried in the LKB system.",
