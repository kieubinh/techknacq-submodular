        "We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns (or their near equivalents, selectional patterns and subcategorization patterns) from large corpus data.",
        "In our view, the acquisition of case frame patterns involves the following three subtasks: (1) extracting case frame instances from corpus data, (2) generalizing case frame slots within the case frames, and (3) learning dependencies that exist between the (generalized) case frame slots.",
        "We consider here the third of these subtasks and propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots.",
        "The term \"dependency\" refers to the relationship that may exist between case slots and that indicates strong co-occurrence between the values of those case slots.",
        "For example, consider the following sentences:",
        "(1) She flies jets.",
        "(2) That airline company flies jets.",
        "(3) She flies Japan Airlines.",
        "(4) *That airline company flies Japan Airlines.",
        "We see that airline company can be the value of the arg1 (subject) slot, when the value of the arg2 (direct object) slot is airplane but not when it is airline company.",
        "These sentences indicate that the possible values of case slots depend in general on those of others: dependencies between case slots exist.'",
        "The knowledge of dependencies between case slots is useful in various tasks in natural language processing, especially in analyzing sentences involving multiple prepositional phrases, such as The girl will fly a jet from Tokyo to Beijing.",
        "Note in this example",
        "that the slot of from and that of to should be considered dependent and the attachment site of one of the prepositional phrases (case slots) can be determined by that of the other with high accuracy and confidence.",
        "There has not been a general method proposed to date, however, that learns dependencies between case slots.",
        "Methods of resolving ambiguities have been based, for example, on the assumption that case slots are mutually independent (Hindle and Rooth 1991), or at most two case slots are dependent (Collins and Brooks 1995).",
        "In this article, we propose an efficient and general method of learning dependencies between case frame slots."

        "Suppose that we have frequency data of the type shown in Table 1 automatically extracted from a corpus, in which words in the slots are replaced by the classes they belong to.",
        "We assume that case frame instances with a given verb are generated by a discrete joint probability distribution of the form Pr(xi, x2, xn), where Py stands for the verb, and each of the random variables Xi, i = 1, 2, ... , n, represents a case slot.",
        "We then formulate the dependencies between case slots as the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables.",
        "Such a joint distribution can be represented by three alternative types of probabilistic models according to the type of values each random variable X, assumes.",
        "When Xi assumes a word or a special symbol \"0\" as its value, we refer to the corresponding model as a word-based model.",
        "Here 0 indicates the absence of the case slot in question.",
        "When X, assumes a word-class (such as (person) or (company)) or 0 as its value, the corresponding model is called a class-based model.",
        "When X, takes on 1 or 0 as its value, we call the model a slot-based model.",
        "Here the value of 1 indicates the presence of the case slot in question, and 0 the absence thereof.",
        "The number of parameters in a joint distribution will be exponential, however, if we allow interdependencies among all of the variables (even the slot-based model has 0(2n) parameters), and thus their accurate and efficient estimation may not be feasible in practice.",
        "It is often assumed implicitly in statistical natural language processing that case slots (or the corresponding random variables) are mutually independent.",
        "Although assuming that they are mutually independent would drastically reduce the number of parameters (e.g., under the independence assumption, the number of parameters in a slot-based model becomes 0(n)), as illustrated above, this assumption is not necessarily valid in practice.",
        "Li and Abe Learning Dependencies What seems to be true in practice is that some case slots are in fact dependent on one another, but that the overwhelming majority of them are mutually independent, due partly to the fact that usually only a few case slots are obligatory; the others are optional.",
        "(Optional case slots are not necessarily independent, but if two optional case slots are randomly selected, it is very likely that they are independent of one another.)",
        "Thus the target joint distribution is likely to be approximatable as the product of lower-order component distributions, and thus has, in fact, a reasonably small number of parameters.",
        "In general, any n-dimensional joint distribution can be written as = HP(X„,, , Xm,_1) for some permutation (mi, rt12.",
        "inn) of (1, 2, .. .",
        ", n), letting P(Xm, I Xmo ) denote P(Xmi ).",
        "A plausible assumption regarding the dependencies between these random variables is that each variable directly depends on at most one other variable.",
        "This is one of the simplest assumptions that can be made to relax the independence assumption.",
        "For example, if the joint distribution P(Xi, X2, X3) over 3 random variables Xi, X2, X3 can be written (approximated) as P(Xi ).P(X2 I Xi) .P(X3 I X2), it (approximately) satisfies such an assumption.",
        "We call such a distribution a dependency forest model.",
        "A dependency forest model can be represented by a dependency forest (i.e., a set of dependency trees), whose nodes represent random variables (each labeled with a number of parameters), and whose directed links represent the dependencies that exist between these random variables.",
        "A dependency forest model is thus a restricted form of the Bayesian network (note that it is also an extension of the first-order Markov chain model).",
        "Now we turn to the problem of how to select the best dependency forest model from among all possible ones to approximate a target joint distribution based on input data.",
        "This problem has already been investigated in the area of machine learning and related fields.",
        "In particular, Suzuki (1993) has devised an algorithm, based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen 1989), which estimates the target joint distribution as a dependency forest model (see Li [1998] for a derivation of this algorithm from MDL).",
        "Figure 1 shows this algorithm, for which k, and kJ denote,",

        "Our program actually induces the set of possible values of a random variable from those in the input data and thus here kargi = 2.",

        "The dependency forest in Figure 2 is then constructed.",
        "The dependency forest indicates that there is dependency between the to slot and the arg2 slot, and between the to slot and the from slot, but the arg1 slot is independent from all others.",
        "Note that this algorithm in fact outputs a forest consisting of labeled free trees.",
        "A labeled free tree is a tree in which each node is uniquely associated with a label and the root node is left unspecified.",
        "After applying the algorithm, any node can be designated as the root of that tree, since the dependency models based on the same labeled free tree are all equivalent (cf. Li 1998)."

        "Specifically, it calculates the so-called t-score, which is a statistic about the difference between the two probabilities.",
        "Here, we first employ the proposed dependency learning method to judge if slots Xarg2 and Xfrom with respect to verb fly are mutually dependent.",

        "In such cases, we made a default decision – namely, we forcibly attached (p, n2) to v. This is because we found empirically for our data set that for what remains after applying LA or DepenLA, it is most likely that (p, n2) goes with v. Table 3 summarizes the results, which are evaluated in terms of disambiguation accuracy averaged over the ten trials.",
        "Table 3 also gives the standard deviation (±) of each accuracy value, calculated based on the assumption that the 10 cross-validation trials are statistically independent.",
