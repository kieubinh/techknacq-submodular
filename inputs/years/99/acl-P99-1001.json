        "The possibilities for data mining from large text collections are virtually untapped.",
        "Text expresses a vast, rich range of information, but encodes this information in a form that is difficult to decipher automatically.",
        "Perhaps for this reason, there has been little work in text data mining to date, and most people who have talked about it have either conflated it with information access or have not made use of text directly to discover heretofore unknown information.",
        "In this paper I will first define data mining, information access, and corpus-based computational linguistics, and then discuss the relationship of these to text data mining.",
        "The intent behind these contrasts is to draw attention to exciting new kinds of problems for computational linguists.",
        "I describe examples of what I consider to be real text data mining efforts and briefly outline recent ideas about how to pursue exploratory data analysis over text."

        "The nascent field of text data mining (TDM) has the peculiar distinction of having a name and a fair amount of hype but as yet almost no practitioners.",
        "I suspect this has happened because people assume TDM is a natural extension of the slightly less nascent field of data mining (DM), also known as knowledge discovery in databases (Fayyad and Uthurusamy, 1999), and information archeology (Brachman et al., 1993).",
        "Additionally, there are some disagreements about what actually constitutes data mining.",
        "It turns out that \"mining\" is not a very good metaphor for what people in the field actually do.",
        "Mining implies extracting precious nuggets of ore from otherwise worthless rock.",
        "If data mining really followed this metaphor, it would mean that people were discovering new factoids within their inventory databases.",
        "However, in practice this is not really the case.",
        "Instead, data mining applications tend to be (semi)automated discovery of trends and patterns across very large datasets, usually for the purposes of decision making (Fayyad and Uthu-rusamy, 1999; Fayyad, 1997).",
        "Part of what I wish to argue here is that in the case of text, it can be interesting to take the mining-for-nuggets metaphor seriously.",
        "The various contrasts discussed below are summarized in Table 1."

        "It is important to differentiate between text data mining and information access (or information retrieval, as it is more widely known).",
        "The goal of information access is to help users find documents that satisfy their information needs (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).",
        "The standard procedure is akin to looking for needles in a needlestack – the problem isn't so much that the desired information is not known, but rather that the desired information coexists with many other valid pieces of information.",
        "Just because a user is currently interested in NAFTA and not Furbies does not mean that all descriptions of Furbies are worthless.",
        "The problem is one of homing in on what is currently of interest to the user.",
        "As noted above, the goal of data mining is to discover or derive new information from data, finding patterns across datasets, and/or separating signal from noise.",
        "The fact that an information retrieval system can return a document that contains the information a user requested implies that no new discovery is being made: the information had to have already been known to the author of the text; otherwise the author could not have written it down.",
        "I have observed that many people, when asked about text data mining, assume it should have something to do with \"making things easier to find on the web\".",
        "For example, the description of the KDD-97 panel on Data Mining and the Web stated: ... Two challenges are predominant for data mining on the Web.",
        "The first goal is to help users in finding useful information on the Web and in discovering knowledge about a domain that is represented by a collection of Web-documents.",
        "The second goal is to analyse the transactions run in a Web-based system, be it to optimize the system or to find information about the clients using the system.1 This search-centric view misses the point that we might actually want to treat the information in the web as a large knowledge base from which we can extract new, never-before encountered information (Craven et al., 1998).",
        "On the other hand, the results of certain types of text processing can yield tools that indirectly aid in the information access process.",
        "Examples include text clustering to create thematic overviews of text collections (Cutting et al., 1992; Chalmers and Chitson, 1992; Rennison, 1994; Wise et al., 1995; Lin et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1998), automatically generating term associations to aid in query expansion (Peat and Willett, 1991; Voorhees, 1994; Xu and Croft, 1996), and using co-citation analysis to find general topics within a collection or identify central web pages (White and McCain, 1989; Larson, 1996; Kleinberg, 1998).",
        "Aside from providing tools to aid in the standard information access process, I think text data mining can contribute along another dimension.",
        "In future I hope to see information access systems supplemented with tools for exploratory data analysis.",
        "Our efforts in this direction are embodied in the LINDI project, described in Section 5 below."

        "Empirical computational linguistics computes statistics over large text collections in order to discover useful patterns.",
        "These patterns are used to inform algorithms for various subproblems within natural language processing, such as part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation, and bilingual dictionary creation (Armstrong, 1994).",
        "It is certainly of interest to a computational linguist that the words \"prices, prescription, and patent\" are highly likely to co-occur with the medical sense of \"drug\" while \"abuse, paraphernalia, and illicit\" are likely to co-occur with the illegal drug sense of this word (Church and Liberman, 1991).",
        "This kind of information can also be used to improve information retrieval algorithms.",
        "However, the kinds of patterns found and used in computational linguistics are not likely to be what the general business community hopes for when they use the term text data mining.",

        "Examples include automatic augmentation of WordNet relations (Fellbaum, 1998) by identifying lexicosyntactic patterns that unambiguously indicate those relations (Hearst, 1998), and automatic acquisition of subcategorization data from large text corpora (Manning, 1993).",

        "Text categorization is a boiling down of the specific content of a document into one (or more) of a set of predefined labels.",
        "This does not lead to discovery of new information; presumably the person who wrote the document knew what it was about.",
        "Rather, it produces a",
        "compact summary of something that is already known.",
        "However, there are two recent areas of inquiry that make use of text categorization and do seem to fit within the conceptual framework of discovery of trends and patterns within textual data for more general purpose usage.",
        "One body of work uses text category labels (associated with Reuters newswire) to find \"unexpected patterns\" among text articles (Feldman and Dagan, 1995; Dagan et al., 1996; Feldman et al., 1997).",
        "The main approach is to compare distributions of category assignments within subsets of the document collection.",
        "For instance, distributions of commodities in country Cl are compared against those of country C2 to see if interesting or unexpected trends can be found.",
        "Extending this idea, one country's export trends might be compared against those of a set of countries that are seen as an economic unit (such as the 0-7).",
        "Another effort is that of the DARPA Topic Detection and Tracking initiative (Allan et al., 1998).",
        "While several of the tasks within this initiative are standard text analysis problems (such as categorization and segmentation), there is an interesting task called On-line New Event Detection, whose input is a stream of news stories in chronological order, and whose output is a yes/no decision for each story, made at the time the story arrives, indicating whether the story is the first reference to a newly occurring event.",
        "In other words, the system must detect the first instance of what will become a series of reports on some important topic.",
        "Although this can be viewed as a standard classification task (where the class is a binary assignment to the new-event class) it is more in the spirit of data mining, in that the focus is on discovery of the beginning of a new theme or trend.",
        "The reason I consider this examples – using multiple occurrences of text categories to detect trends or patterns – to be \"real\" data mining is that they use text metadata to tell us something about the world, outside of the text collection itself.",
        "(However, since this application uses metadata associated with text documents, rather than the text directly, it is unclear if it should be considered text data mining or standard data mining.)",
        "The computational linguistics applications tell us about how to improve language analysis, but they do not discover more widely usable information."

        "• stress is associated with migraines • stress can lead to loss of magnesium • calcium channel blockers prevent some migraines • magnesium is a natural calcium channel blocker • spreading cortical depression (SCD) is implicated in some migraines • high leveles of magnesium inhibit SCD • migraine patients have high platelet aggre-gability • magnesium can suppress platelet aggregability",
        "These clues suggest that magnesium deficiency may play a role in some kinds of migraine headache; a hypothesis which did not exist in the literature at the time Swanson found these links.",
        "The hypothesis has to be tested via non-textual means, but the important point is that a new, potentially plausible medical hypothesis was derived from a combination of text fragments and the explorer's medical expertise.",

        "The interaction is a cycle in which the system suggests hypotheses and strategies for investigating these hypotheses, and the user either uses or ignores these suggestions and decides on the next move.",
        "We are interested in an important problem in molecular biology, that of automating the discovery of the function of newly sequenced genes (Walker et al., 1998).",
        "Human genome researchers perform experiments in which they analyze co-expression of tens of thousands of novel and known genes simultaneously.4 Given this huge collection of genetic information, the goal is to determine which of the novel genes are medically interesting, meaning that they are co-expressed with already understood genes which are known to be involved in disease.",
