        "The field of automatic speech recognition has witnessed a number of significant advances in the past 5 - 10 years, spurred on by advances in signal processing, algorithms, computational architectures, and hardware.",
        "These advances include the widespread adoption of a statistical pattern recognition paradigm, a data-driven approach which makes use of a rich set of speech utterances from a large population of speakers, the use of stochastic acoustic and language modeling, and the use of dynamic programming-based search methods.",
        "A series of (D)ARPA projects have been a major driving force of the recent progress in research on large-vocabulary, continuous-speech recognition.",
        "Specifically, dictation of speech reading newspapers, such as north America business newspapers including the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and conversational speech recognition using an Air Travel Information System (ATIS) task were actively investigated.",
        "More recent DARPA programs are the broadcast news dictation and natural conversational speech recognition using Switchboard and Call Home tasks.",
        "Research on human-computer dialogue systems, the Communicator program, has also started [1].",
        "Various other systems have been actively investigated in US, Europe and Japan stimulated by DARPA projects.",
        "Most of them can be classified into either dictation systems or human-computer dialogue systems.",
        "Figure 1 shows a mechanism of state-of-the-art speech recognizers [2].",
        "Common features of these systems are the use of cepstral parameters and their regression coefficients as speech features, triphone HMMs as acoustic models, vocabularies of several thousand or several ten thousand entries, and stochastic language models such as bigrams and trigrams.",
        "Such methods have",
        "been applied not only to English but also to French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese.",
        "Although there are several language-specific characteristics, similar recognition results have been obtained.",
        "Recognized word sequence world domain of obvious value has lead to rapid technology transfer of speech recognition into other research areas and applications.",
        "Since the variations in speaking style and accent as well as in channel and environment conditions are totally unconstrained, broadcast news is a superb stress test that requires new algorithms to work across widely varying conditions.",
        "Algorithms need to solve a specific problem without degrading any other condition.",
        "Another advantage of this domain is that news is easy to collect and the supply of data is boundless.",
        "The data is found speech; it is completely uncontrived."

        "To calculate word n-gram language models, we segmented the broadcast-news manuscripts into words by using a morphological analyzer since Japanese sentences are written without spaces between words.",
        "A word-frequency list was derived for the news manuscripts, and the 20k most frequently used words were selected as vocabulary words.",
        "This 20k vocabulary covers about 98% of the words in the broadcast-news manuscripts.",

        "Most Kanji have multiple readings, and correct readings can only be decided according to context.",
        "Conventional language models usually assign equal probability to all possible readings of each word.",
        "This causes recognition errors because the assigned probability is sometimes very different from the true probability.",
        "We therefore constructed a language model that depends on the readings of words in order to take into account the frequency and context-dependency of the readings.",
        "Broadcast news speech includes filled pauses at the beginning and in the middle of sentences, which cause recognition errors in our language models that use news manuscripts written prior to broadcasting.",
        "To cope with this problem, we introduced filled-pause modeling into the language model.",
        "News speech data, from TV broadcasts in July 1996, were divided into two parts, a clean part and a noisy part, and were separately evaluated.",
        "The clean part consisted of utterances with no background noise, and the noisy part consisted of utterances with background noise.",
        "The noisy part included spontaneous speech such as reports by correspondents.",
        "We extracted 50 male utterances and 50 female utterances for each part, yielding four evaluation sets; male-clean (m/c), male-noisy (mm), female-clean (f/c), female-noisy (f/n).",
        "Each set included utterances by five or six speakers.",
        "All utterances were manually segmented into sentences.",
        "Table 1 shows the experimental results for the baseline language model (LM1) and the new language models.",
        "LM2 is the reading-dependent language model, and LM3 is a modification of LM2 by filled-pause modeling.",
        "For clean speech, LM2 reduced the word error rate by 4.7 % relative to LM1, and LM3 model reduced the word error rate by 10.9 % relative to LM2 on average."
