        "Research on discourse structure has, by and large, attempted to associate all meaningful relations between propositions with structural connections between discourse clauses (syntactic clauses or structures composed of them).",
        "Recognising that this could mean multiple structural connections between clauses, Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) simply stipulates that only a single relation may hold.",
        "Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both informational (semantic) and intentional relations can hold between clauses simultaneously and independently.",
        "This suggests that factoring the two kinds of relations might lead to a pair of structures, each still with no more than a single structural connection between any two clauses.",
        "But examples of multiple semantic relations are easy to find (Webber et al., 1999).",
        "Having structure account for all of them leads to the complexities shown in Figure 1, including the crossing dependencies shown in Fig. 1 c. These structures are no longer trees, making it difficult to define a compositional semantics.",
        "This problem would not arise if one recognised additional, non-structural means of conveying semantic relations between propositions and modal",
        "operators on propositions.",
        "This is what we do here: • Structurally, we assume a \"bare bones\" discourse structure built up from more complex elements (LTAG trees) than those used in many other approaches.",
        "These structures and the operations used in assembling them are the basis for compositional semantics.",
        "• Stimulated by structural operations, inference based on world knowledge, usage conventions, etc., can then make defeasible contributions to discourse interpretation that elaborate the non-defeasible propositions contributed by compositional semantics.",
        "• Non-structurally, we take additional semantic relations and modal operators to be conveyed through anaphoric presuppositions (Van der Sandt, 1992) licensed by information that speaker and hearer are taken to share.",
        "A main source of shared knowledge is the interpretation of the ongoing discourse.",
        "Because the entity that licences (or \"discharges\") a given presupposition usually has a source within the discourse, the presupposition seems to link the clause containing the presupposition-bearing (p-bearing) element to that source.",
        "However, as with pronominal and definite NP anaphora, while attentional constraints on their interpretation may be influenced by structure, the links themselves are not structural.",
        "The idea of combining compositional semantics with defeasible inference is not new.",
        "Neither is the idea of taking certain lexical items as anaphorically presupposing an eventuality or a set of eventualities: It is implicit in all work on the anaphoric nature of tense (cf. Partee (1984), Webber (1988), inter alia) and modality (Stone, 1999).",
        "What is new is the way we enable anaphoric presupposition to contribute to semantic relations and modal operators, in a way",
        "that does not lead to the violations of tree structure mentioned earlier.' We discuss these differences in more detail in Section 2, after describing the lexicalised framework that facilitates the derivation of discourse semantics from structure, inference and anaphoric presuppositions.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 then present more detailed semantic analyses of the connectives for example and otherwise.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our arguments for the approach and suggest a program of future work."

        "In previous papers (Cristea and Webber, 1997; Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999), we have argued for using the more complex structures (elementary trees) of a Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) and its operations (adjoining and substitution) to associate structure and semantics with a sequence of discourse clauses.2 Here we briefly review how it works.",
        "In a lexicalized TAG, each elementary tree has at least one anchor.",
        "In the case of discourse, the anchor for an elementary tree may be a lexical item, punctuation or a feature structure that is lexically null.",
        "The semantic contribution of a lexical anchor includes both what it presupposes and what it asserts (Stone and Doran, 1997; Stone, 1998; Stone and Webber, 1998).",
        "A feature structure anchor will either unify with a lexical item with compatible features (Knott and Mellish, 1996), yielding the previous case, or have an empty realisation, though one 'One may still need to admit structures having both a link back and a link forward to different clauses (Gardent, 1997).",
        "But a similar situation can occur within the clause, with relative clause dependencies – from the verb back to the relative pronoun and forward to a trace – so the possibility is not unmotivated from the perspective of syntax.",
        "2We take this to be only the most basic level of discourse structure, producing what are essentially extended descriptions of situations/events.",
        "Discourse may be further structured with respect to speaker intentions, genre-specific presentations, etc.",
        "that maintains its semantic features.",
        "The initial elementary trees used here correspond, by and large, to second-order predicate-argument structures – i.e., usually binary predicates on propositions or eventualities – while the auxiliary elementary trees provide further information (constraints) added through adjoining.",
        "Importantly, we bar crossing structural connections.",
        "Thus one diagnostic for taking a predicate argument to be anaphoric rather than structural is whether it can derive from across a structural link.",
        "The relation in a subordinate clause is clearly structural: Given two relations, one realisable as \"Although a p, the other realisable as \"Because y 8\", they cannot together be realised as \"Although a because y 13 8.\"",

        "The explanation of Example 2a is primarily structural.",
        "It involves an initial tree (y) anchored by \"because\" (Figure 2).",

        "Informally, \"for example\" presupposes a shared set of eventualities, and asserts that the eventuality associated with the clause it adjoins to, is a member of that set.",
        "In Example 2c, the set is licensed by \"because\" as the set of causes/reasons for the situation associated with its first argument.",
        "Thus, associated with the derivation of (2c) are the assertions that the situation associated with B is a cause for that associated with A and that the situation associated with B is one of a set of such causes.",
        "Finally, Example 2d adds to the elements used in Example 2b, the same auxiliary tree anchored by \"for example\" (8).",
        "As in Example 2b, the causality relation between the interpretations of B and A comes defeasibly from general inference.",
        "Of interest then is how the presupposition of \"for ex-ample\" is licenced – that is, what provides the shared set or generalisation that the interpretation of B is asserted to exemplify.",
        "It appears to be li-cenced by the causal relation that has been inferred to hold between the eventualities denoted by B and A, yielding a set of causes/reasons for A.",
        "Thus, while we do not yet have a complete characterisation of how compositional semantics, defeasible inference and anaphoric presupposition interact, Examples 2c and 2d illustrate one significant feature: Both the interpretive contribution of a structural connective like \"because\" and the defeasible inference stimulated by adjoining can license the anaphoric presupposition of a p-bearing element like \"for example\".",
        "Recently, Asher and Lascarides (1999) have described a version of Structured Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) that also incorporates the semantic contributions of both presuppositions and assertions.",

        "We illustrate these differences through Example 1 (repeated below), with the p-bearing element \"then\", and Example 5, with the p-bearing element \"too\".",

        "In Example 1, the presupposition of \"then\" in (d) is licensed by the eventuality evoked by (b), which would not be on the right frontier of any structural analysis.",
        "If \"too\" is taken to presuppose shared knowledge of a similar eventuality, then the \"too\" in Example 5(g) finds that eventuality in (b), which is also unlikely to be on the right frontier of any structural analysis.4",
        "With respect to the interpretation of \"too\", Asher and Lascarides take it to presuppose a parallel rhetorical relation between the current clause and something on the right frontier.",
        "From this instantiated rhetorical relation, one then infers that the related eventualities are similar.",
        "But if the right frontier constraint is incorrect and the purpose of positing a rhetorical relation like parallel is to produce an assertion of similarity, then one might as well take \"too\" as directly presupposing shared knowledge of a similar eventuality, as we have done here.",
        "Thus, we suggest that the insights presented in (Asher and Lascarides, 1999) have a simpler explanation.",
        "Now, before embarking on more detailed analyses of two quite different p-bearing adverbs, we should clarify the scope of the current approach in terms of the range of p-bearing elements that can create non-structural discourse links.",
        "We believe that systematic study, perhaps starting with the 350 \"cue phrases\" given in (Knott, 1996, Appendix A), will show which of them use presupposition in realising discourse relations.",
        "It is likely that these might include:",
        "• temporal conjunctions and adverbial connectives presupposing an eventuality that stands in a particular temporal relation to the one currently in hand, such as \"then\", \"later\", \"meanwhile\", \"afterwards\", \"beforehand\"; • adverbial connectives presupposing shared knowledge of a generalisation or set, such",

        "For this study, one might be able to use the structure-crossing test given in Section 2 to distinguish a relation whose arguments are both given structurally from a relation which has one of its arguments presupposed.",
        "(Since such a test won't distinguish p-bearing connectives such as \"meanwhile\" from non-relational adverbials such as \"at dawn\" and \"tonight\", the latter will have to be excluded by other means, such as the (pre-theoretical) test for relational phrases given in (Knott, 1996).)"

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have shown that discourse structure need not bear the full burden of discourse semantics: Part of it can be borne by other means.",
        "This keeps discourse structure simple and able to support a straightforward compositional semantics.",
        "Specifically, we have argued that the notion of anaphoric presupposition that was introduced by van der Sandt (1992) to explain the interpretation of various definite noun phrases could also be seen as underlying the semantics of various discourse connectives.",
        "Since these presuppositions are licensed by eventualities taken to be shared knowledge, a good source of which is the interpretation of the discourse so far, anaphoric presupposition can be seen as carrying some of the burden of discourse connectivity and discourse semantics in a way that avoids crossing dependencies.",
        "There is, potentially, another benefit to factoring the sources of discourse semantics in this way: while cross-linguistically, inference and anaphoric presupposition are likely to behave similarly, structure (as in syntax) is likely to be more language specific.",
        "Thus a factored approach has a better chance of providing a cross-linguistic account of discourse than one that relies on a single premise.",
        "Clearly, more remains to be done.",
        "First, the approach demands a precise semantics for connectives, as in the work of Grote (1998), Grote et al.",
        "(1997), Jayez and Rossari (1998) and Lagerwerf (1998).",
        "Secondly, the approach demands an understanding of the attentional characteristics of presuppositions.",
        "In particular, preliminary study seems to suggest that p-bearing elements differ in what source can license them, where this source can be located, and what can act as distractors for this source.",
        "In fact, these differences seem to resemble the range of differences in the information status (Prince, 1981; Prince, 1992) or familiarity (Gundel et al., 1993) of referential NPs.",
        "Consider, for example: (11) I got in my old Volvo and set off to drive cross-country and see as many different mountain ranges as possible.",
        "When I got to Arkansas, for example, I stopped in the Ozarks, although I had to borrow another car to see them because Volvos handle badly on steep grades.",
        "Here, the definite NP-like presupposition of the \"when\" clause (that getting to Arkansas is shared knowledge) is licensed by driving cross-country; the presupposition of \"for example\" (that stopping in the Ozarks exemplifies some shared generalisation) is licensed by seeing many mountain ranges, and the presupposition of \"another\" (that an alternative car to this one is shared knowledge) is licensed by my Volvo.",
        "This suggests a corpus annotation effort for anaphoric presuppositions, similar to ones already in progress on co-reference.",
        "Finally, we should show that the approach has practical benefit for NL understanding and/or generation.",
        "But the work to date surely shows the benefit of an approach that narrows the gap between discourse syntax and semantics and that of the clause."
