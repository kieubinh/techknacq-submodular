        "(Dalrymple et al., 1991; Shieber et al., 1996) (henceforth DSP) present a treatment of VP-ellipsis which can be sketched as follows.",
        "An elliptical construction involves two phrases (usually clauses) which are in some sense structurally parallel.",
        "Whereas the first clause (we refer to it as the source) is semantically complete, the second (or target) clause is missing semantic material which can be recovered from the source.",
        "Formally the analysis consists of two components: the representation of the overall discourse (i.e. source and target clauses) and an equation which permits recovering the missing semantics.",

        ", SO = S S is the semantic representation of the source, S1, , Si, and T1, , 77,,, are the semantic representations of the parallel elements in the source and target respectively and R represents the relation to be recovered.",
        "The equation is solved using Higher-Order Unification (HOU): Given any solvable equation M = N, HOU yields a substitution of terms for free variables that makes M and N equal in the theory of On – identity.",
        "The following example illustrates the workings of this analysis:",
        "(1) Jon likes Sarah and Peter does too.",
        "In this case the semantic representation and the equation associated with the overall discourse are: For this equation, HOU yields the substitutionl: {R + – Ax.like(x,․)} and as a result, the resolved semantics of the target is:",
        "The DSP approach has become very influential in computational linguistics for two main reasons.",
        "First, it accounts for a wide range of observations concerning the interaction of VP-ellipsis, quantification and anaphora.",
        "Second, it bases semantic construction on a tool, HOU, which is both theoretically and computationally attractive.",
        "Theoretically, HOU is well-defined and well-understood – this permits a clear understanding of both the limitations and the predictions of the approach.",
        "Computationally, it has both a declarative and a procedural interpretation – this supports both transparency and implementation.",
        "In this paper, I start (section 2) by clarifying the relationship between DSP's proposal and the semantic representation of discourse anaphors.",
        "In section 3 and 4, I then show that the HOU-treatment of ellipsis naturally extends to provide:",

        "The main tenet of the DSP approach is that interpreting an elliptical clause involves recovering a relation from the source clause and applying it to the target elements.",
        "This leaves open the question of how this procedure relates to sentence level semantic construction and in particular to the semantic representation of VP-ellipsis.",
        "Consider for instance the following example:",
        "(2) Jon runs but Peter doesn't.",
        "Under the DSP analysis, the unresolved semantics of (2) is (3)a and equation (3)b is set up.",
        "HOU yields the solution given in (3)c and as a result, the semantics of the target clause",
        "It is unclear how the semantic representation (3)a comes about.",
        "Under a Montague-type approach where syntactic categories map onto semantic types, the semantic type of a VP-Ellipsis is (et), the type of properties of individuals i.e. unary relations, not binary ones.",
        "And under a standard treatment of subject NPs and auxiliaries, one would expect the representation of the target clause to be neg(P(peter)) not P(neg)(peter).",
        "There is thus a discrepancy between the representation DSP posit for the target, and the semantics generated by a standard, Montague-style semantic construction module.",
        "Furthermore, although DSP only apply their analysis to VP-ellipsis, they have in mind a much broader range of applications: [...] many other elliptical phenomena and related phenomena subject to multiple readings akin to the strict and sloppy readings discussed here may be analysed using the same techniques (Dalrymple et al., 1991, page 450).",
        "In particular, one would expect the HOU-analysis to support a general theory of sloppy identity.",
        "For instance, one would expect it to account for the sloppy interpretation (I'll kiss you if you don't want me to kiss you) of (4).",
        "(4) I'll [help youll if you [want me to1]2.",
        "But for such cases, the discrepancy between the semantic representation generated by semantic construction and the DSP representation of the target is even more obvious.",
        "Assuming help and kiss are the parallel elements, the equation generated by the DSP proposal is:",
        "and accordingly, the semantic representation of the target is -,R(k) which is in stark contrast with what one could reasonably expect from a standard semantic construction process namely:",
        "What is missing is a constraint which states that the representation of the target must unify with the semantic representation generated by the semantic construction component.",
        "If we integrate this constraint into the DSP account, we get the following representations and constraints: Representation S A R(Ti, • • • ,T) Equations R(Si,... ,S) = S R(Ti,... ,Tn) = T where T is the semantic representation generated for the target by the semantic construction module.",
        "The second equation requires that this representation T unifies with the representation of the target postulated by DSP.",
        "With this clarification in mind, example (2) is handled as follows.",
        "The semantic representation",
        "of (2) is (6)a where the semantic representation of the target clause is the representation one would expect from a standard Montague-style semantic construction process.",
        "The equations are as given in (6)b-c where C represents the semantics shared by the parallel structures and P the VP-Ellipsis.",
        "HOU then yields the solution in (6)d: the value of C is that relation shared by the two structures i.e. a binary relation as in DSP.",
        "However the value of P (the semantic representation of the VPE) is a property - as befits a verbal phrase.",
        "In sum, provided one equation is added to the DSP system, the relation between the HOU-approach to VP-ellipsis and standard Montague-style semantic construction becomes transparent.",
        "Furthermore it also becomes immediately obvious that the DSP approach does indeed generalise to a much wider range of data than just VP-Ellipsis.",
        "The key point is that there is now not just one, but several, free variables coming into play; and that although the free variable C always represents the semantics shared by two parallel structures, the free variable(s) occuring in the semantic representation of the target may represent any kind of unresolved discourse anaphors - not just ellipsis.",
        "Consider the following example for instance: (7) Joni took hisi wife to the station.",
        "No, BILL took his wife to the station.",
        "There is no ellipsis in the target, yet the discourse is ambiguous between a strict and a sloppy interpretation2 and one would expect the HOU-analysis to extend to such cases.",
        "Which indeed is the case.",
        "The analysis goes as follows.",
        "21 assume that in the target took his wife to the station is deaccented.",
        "In such cases, it is clear that the ambiguity of his is restricted by parallelism i.e. is a sloppy/strict ambiguity rather than just an ambiguity in the choice of antecedent.",
        "As for ellipsis, anaphors in the source are resolved, whereas discourse anaphors in the target are represented using free variables (alternatively, we could resolve them first and let HOU filter unsuitable resolutions out).",
        "Specifically, the target pronoun his is represented by the free variable X and therefore we have the following representation and equations: HOU yields inter alia two solutions for these equations, the first yielding a strict and the second, a sloppy reading:"

        "Because they all use focus to determine the focus value and thereby the semantics of sentences such as (8a), focus deaccenting is a challenge for most theories of focus.",
        "So for instance, in the HOU-analysis of both (Pulman, 1997) and (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996a), the right-hand side of the focus equation for (10b) becomes FV(F) where neither FV (the focus value) nor F (the focus) are known.",
        "As a result, the equation is untyped and cannot be solved by Huet's algorithm (Huet, 1976).",
        "The solution is simple: if there is no focus, there is no focus equation.",
        "After all, it is the presence of a focus which triggers the formation of a focus value.",

        "(Rooth, 1992a) convincingly argues that deaccenting and VP-ellipsis are constrained by the same semantic redundancy constraint (and that VP-ellipsis is additionally subject to a syntactic constraint on the reconstructed VP).",
        "Moreover, (Gardent, 1999) shows that the equational constraints defined in (5) adequately characterise the redundancy constraint which holds for both VPE and deaccenting.",
        "Now example (10b) clearly is a case of deaccenting: because it repeats the VP of (10a), the VP only likes mary in (10b) is deaccented.",

        "Such an approach is in line with (Krifka, 1992) which argues that the repeated material in an SOE is an anaphor resolving to its source counterpart.",
        "It is also partially in line with Rooth's account in that it similarly posits an initially underspecified semantics for the target; It is more specific than Rooth's however, as it lifts this underspecification by unification.",

        "Provided only likes Mary is deaccented, this discourse is ill-formed (unless the second speaker knows Sarah and Mary to denote the same individual).",

        "Without going into the details of Rooth's treatment of focus, let it suffice to say, that the first clause does actually provide the appropriate antecedent for this pragmatic anaphor so that despite its ill-formedness, (11) is assigned a full-fledged interpretation.",

        "Because it interleaves a co-recursion on semantic structures with full inferencing (to prove similarity between semantic entities), Hobbs and Kehler's approach is more powerful than the HOU – approach which is based on a strictly syntactic operation (no semantic reasoning occurs).",
        "Furthermore, because it can represent coreferences explicitely, it achieves a better account of the interaction between VP – ellipsis and anaphora (in particular, it accounts for the infamous \"missing reading puzzles\" of ellipsis (Fiengo and May, 1994)).",
        "On the other hand, the equational approach",
        "provided by the HOU-treatment of parallelism naturally supports the interaction of distinct phenomena.",
        "We have seen that it correctly captures the interaction of parallelism and focus.",
        "Further afield, (Niehren et al., 1997) shows that context unification supports a purely equational treatment of the interaction between ellipsis and quantification whereas (Shieber et al., 1996) presents a very extensive HOU-based treatment of the interaction between scope and ellipsis."
