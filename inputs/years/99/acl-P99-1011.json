        "A grammar is, among other things, a device by which it is possible to express structure in a set of entities; a grammar formalism, the constraints on how a grammar is allowed to express this.",
        "Once a grammar has been used to express structural relationships, in many applications there are operations which act at a 'meta level' on the structures expressed by the grammar for example, lifting rules on a dependency grammar to achieve pseudo-projectivity (Kahane et al., 1998), and mapping between synchronised Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber 1994) as in machine translation or syntax-to-semantics transfer.",
        "At this meta level, however, the operations do not themselves exploit any structure.",
        "This paper explores how, in the TAG case, using a meta-level grammar to define meta-level structure resolves the flaws in the ability of Synchronous TAG (S-TAG) to be a representation for applications such as machine translation or paraphrase.",

        "It describes the expressivity problems of STAG as noted in Shieber (1994), and shows how these occur also in syntactic paraphrasing.",
        "It then demonstrates, illustrated by the relative structural complexity which occurs at the meta level in syntactic paraphrase, how a meta-level grammar resolves the representational problems; and it further shows that this has no effect on the generative capacity of STAG."

        "Synchronous TAG, the mapping between two Tree Adjoining Grammars, was first proposed by Shieber and Schabes (1990).",
        "An application proposed concurrently with the definition of STAG was that of machine translation, mapping between English and French (Abeille et al., 1990); work continues in the area, for example using STAG for English-Korean machine translation in a practical system (Palmer et al., 1998).",
        "In mapping between, say, English and French, there is a lexicalised TAG for each language (see XTAG, 1995, for an overview of such a grammar).",
        "Under the definition of TAG, a grammar contains elementary trees, rather than flat rules, which combine together via the operations of substitution and adjunction (composition operations) to form composite structures – derived trees – which will ultimately provide structural representations for an input string if this string is grammatical.",
        "An overview of TAGs is given in Joshi and Schabes (1996).",
        "The characteristics of TAGs make them better suited to describing natural language than Context Free Grammars (CFGs): CFGs are not adequate to describe the entire syntax of natural language (Shieber, 1985), while TAGs are able to provide structures for the constructions problematic for CFGs, and without a much greater generative capacity.",
        "Two particular characteris",
        "tics of TAG that make it well suited to describing natural language are the extended domain of locality (EDL) and factoring recursion from the domain of dependencies (FRD).",
        "In TAG, for instance, information concerning dependencies is given in one tree (EDL): for example, in Figure 1,1 the information that the verb defeated has subject and object arguments is contained in the tree al.",
        "In a CFG, with rules of the form S NP VP and VP – > V NP, it is not possible to have information about both arguments in the same rule unless the VP node is lost.",
        "TAG keeps dependencies together, or local, no matter how far apart the corresponding lexical items are.",
        "FRD means that recursive information – for example, a sequence of adjectives modifying the object noun of defeated – are factored out into separate trees, leaving dependencies together.",
        "A consequence of the TAG definition is that, unlike CFG, a TAG derived tree is not a record of its own derivation.",
        "In CFG, each tree given as a structural description to a string enables the rules applied to be recovered.",
        "In a TAG, this is not possible, so each derived tree has an associated derivation tree.",
        "If the trees in Figure 1 were composed to give a structural description for Garrad cunningly defeated the Sumerians, the derived tree and its corresponding deriva",
        "tion tree would be as in Figure 2.2 Weir (1988) terms the derived tree, and its component elementary trees, OBJECT-LEVEL TREES; the derivation tree is termed a META-LEVEL TREE, since it describes the object-level trees.",
        "The derivation trees are context free (Weir, 1988), that is, they can be expressed by a CFG; Weir showed that applying a TAG yield function to a context free derivation tree (that is, reading the labels off the tree, and substituting or adjoining the corresponding object-level trees as appropriate) will uniquely specify a TAG tree.",
        "Schabes and Shieber (1994) characterise this as a function D from derivation trees to derived trees.",
        "The idea behind STAG is to take two TAGs and link them in an appropriate way so that when substitution or adjunction occurs in a tree in one grammar, then a corresponding composition operation occurs in a tree in the other grammar Because of the way TAG's EDL captures dependencies, it is not problematic to have translations more complex than word-for-word mappings (Abeille et al., 1990).",
        "For example, from the Abeille et al. paper, handling argument swap, as in (1), is straightforward.",
        "These would be represented by tree pairs as in Figure 3.",
        "In these tree pairs, a diacritic (U) represents a link between the trees, such that if a substitution or adjunction occurs at one end of the link, a corresponding operation must occur at the other end, which is situated in the other tree of the same tree pair.",
        "Thus if the tree for John in a7 is substituted at Ti in the left tree of a6, the tree for Jean must be substituted at FT in the right tree.",
        "The diacritic F31 allows a sentential modifier for both trees (e.g. unfortunately I malheureusement).",
        "The original definition of STAG (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), however, had a greater generative capacity than that of its component TAG grammars even though each component grammar could only generate Tree Adjoining Languages (TALs), an STAG pairing two TAG grammars could generate non-TALs.",
        "Hence, a redefinition was proposed (Shieber, 1994).",
        "Under this new definition, the mapping between grammars occurs at the meta level: there is an isomorphism between derivation trees, preserving structure at the meta level, which establishes the translation.",
        "For example, the derivation trees for (1) using the elementary trees of Figure 3 is given in Figure 4; there is a clear isomorphism, with a bijection between nodes, and parent-child relationships preserved in the mapping.",
        "In translation, it is not always possible to have a bijection between nodes.",

        "b.",
        "On espere que Marie manque Jean.",
        "In English, hopefully would be represented by a single tree; in French, on espêre que typically by two.",
        "Shieber (1994) proposed the idea of bounded subderivation to deal with such aberrant cases – treating the two nodes in the derivation tree representing on espêre que as singular, and basing the isomorphism on this.",
        "This idea of bounded subderivation solves several difficulties with the isomorphism requirement, but not all.",
        "An example by Shieber demonstrates that translation involving clitics causes problems under this definition, as in (3).",

        "A potentially unbounded amount of material intervening in the branches of the righthand tree means that an isomorphism between the trees cannot be established under Shieber's specification even with the modification of bounded subderivations.",
        "Shieber suggested that the isomorphism requirement may be overly stringent;",
        "but intuitively, it seems reasonable that what occurs in one grammar should be mirrored in the other in some way, and this reflected in the derivation history.",
        "Section 3 looks at representing syntactic paraphrase in S-TAG, where similar problems are encountered; in doing this, it can be seen more clearly than in translation that the difficulty is caused not by the isomorphism requirement itself but by the fact that the isomorphism does not exploit any of the structure inherent in the derivation trees."

        "The reason for illustrating both is that syntactic paraphrase, because of its structural complexity, is able to illuminate the nature of the problem with STAG.",

        "The tree pair a9 is the one that captures the syntactic rearrangement in this paraphrase; such a tree pair will be termed the STRUCTURAL MAPPING PAIR (SMP).",
        "Taking as a basic set of trees the XTAG standard grammar of English (XTAG, 1995), the derivation tree pair for (4) would be as in Figure 7•3 Apart from a9, each tree in Figure 6 corresponds to an elementary object-level tree, as indicated by its label; the remaining labels, indicated in bold in the meta-level' derivation tree in Figure 7, correspond to the elementary object-level trees forming a9, in much the same way that on espere que is represented by a subderivation comprising an on tree substituted into an espere que tree.",
        "Note that the nodes corresponding to the left tree of the SMP form two discontinuous groups, but these discontinuous groups are clearly related.",
        "Dras (forthcoming) describes the conditions under which these discontinuous groupings are acceptable in paraphrase; these discontinuous groupings are treated as a single block with SLOTS connecting the groupings, whose fillers must be of particular types.",
        "Fundamentally, however, the structure is the same as for clitics: in one derivation tree the grouped elements are in one branch of the tree, and in the other they are in two separate branches with the possibility of an unbounded amount of intervening material, as described below in Section 4."
