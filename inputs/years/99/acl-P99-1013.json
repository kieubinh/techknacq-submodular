        "Developing large scale grammars for natural languages is a complicated task, and the problems grammar engineers face when designing broad-coverage grammars are reminiscent of those tackled by software engineering (Erbach and Uszkoreit, 1990).",

        "It is therefore possible to adapt methods and techniques of software engineering to the domain of natural language formalisms.",
        "We believe that any advances in grammar engineering must be preceded by a more theoretical work, concentrating on the semantics of grammars This view reflects the situation in logic programming, where developments in alternative definitions for predicate logic semantics led to implementations of various program composition operators (Bugliesi et al., 1994).",

        "While most of the results we report on are probably not surprising, we believe that it is important to derive them directly for linguistic formalisms for two reasons.",
        "First, practitioners of linguistic formalisms usually do not view them as instances of a general logic programming framework, but rather as first-class programming environments which deserve independent study.",
        "Second, there are some crucial differences between contemporary linguistic formalisms and, say, Prolog: the basic elements – typed feature-structures – are more general than first-order terms, the notion of unification is different, and computations amount to parsing, rather than SLD-resolution.",
        "The fact that we can derive similar results in this new domain is encouraging, and should not be considered trivial.",
        "Analogously to logic programming languages, the denotation of grammars can be defined using various techniques.",
        "We review alternative approaches, operational and denotational, to the semantics of linguistic formalisms in section 2 and show that they are \"too crude\" to support grammar composition.",
        "Section 3 presents an alternative semantics, shown to be compositional (with respect to grammar union, a simple syntactic combination operation on grammars) However, this definition is \"too fine\": in section 4 we present an adequate, compositional and fully-abstract semantics for linguistic formalisms.",
