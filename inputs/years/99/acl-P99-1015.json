        "Aspectual classification maps clauses to a small set of primitive categories in order to reason about time.",
        "For example, events such as, \"You called your father,\" are distinguished from states such as, \"You resemble your father.\"",
        "These two high-level categories correspond to primitive distinctions in many domains, e.g., the distinction between procedure and diagnosis in the medical domain.",
        "Aspectual classification further distinguishes events according to completedness (i.e., telicity), which determines whether an event reaches a culmination point in time at which a new state is introduced.",
        "For example, \"I made a fire\" is culminated, since a new state is introduced – something is made, whereas, \"I gazed at the sunset\" is non-culminated.",
        "Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain natural language interpretation, natural language generation, sum-marization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.",
        "Aspect introduces a large-scale, domain-dependent lexical classification problem.",
        "Although an aspectual lexicon of verbs would suffice to classify many clauses by their main verb only, a verb's primary class is often domain-dependent (Siegel, 1998b).",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to produce a specialized lexicon for each domain.",
        "Most approaches to automatically categorizing words measure co-occurrences between open-class lexical items (Schfitze, 1992; Hatzi-vassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Pereira et al., 1993).",
        "This approach is limited since co-occurrences between open-class lexical items is sparse, and is not specialized for particular semantic distinctions such as aspect.",
        "In this paper, we describe an expandable framework to classify verbs with linguistically-specialized numerical indicators.",
        "Each linguistic indicator measures the frequency of a lexico-syntactic marker, e.g. the perfect tense.",
        "These markers are linguistically related to aspect, so the indicators are specialized for aspectual classification in particular.",
        "We perform an evaluation of fourteen linguistic indicators over unrestricted sets of verbs from two corpora.",
        "When used in combination, this group of indicators is shown to improve classification performance for two aspectual distinctions: stativity and corn-pletedness.",
        "Moreover, our analysis reveals a predictive value for several indicators that have not previously been discovered to correlate with aspect in the linguistics literature.",
        "The following section further describes aspect, and introduces linguistic insights that are exploited by linguistic indicators.",
        "The next section describes the set of linguistic indicators evaluated in this paper.",

        "This incompleteness has been illustrated empirically by showing that some indicators help for only a subset of verbs (Siegel, 1998b).",

        "This framework is expandable, since additional lexico-syntactic markers may also correlate with aspectual class.",
        "Future work will extend this approach to other semantic distinctions in natural language.",
        "Linguistic indicators successfully exploit linguistic insights to provide a much-needed method for aspectual classification.",
        "When combined with a decision tree to classify according to stativity, the indicators achieve an accuracy of 93.9% and stative recall of 74.2%.",
        "When combined with CART to classify according to corn-pletedness, indicators achieved 74.0% accuracy and 53.1% non-culminated recall.",
        "A favorable tradeoff in recall presents an advantage for applications that weigh the identification of non-dominant classes more heavily (Cardie and Howe, 1997).",
        "For example, correctly identifying occurrences of for that denote event durations relies on positively identifying non-culminated events.",
        "A system that summarizes the duration of events which incorrectly classifies \"She ran (for a minute)\" as culminated will not detect that \"for a minute\" describes the duration of the run event.",
        "This is because durative for-PPs that modify culminated events denote the duration of the ensuing state, e.g., I left the room for a minute.",
        "(Vendler, 1967) Our analysis has revealed several insights regarding individual indicators.",
        "For example, both duration in-PP and manner adverb are particularly valuable for multiple aspectual distinctions – they were ranked in the top two positions by log-linear modeling for both stativity and completedness.",
        "We have discovered several new linguistic indicators that are not traditionally linked to aspectual class.",
        "In particular, verb frequency with no deep subject was positively correlated with both stativity and completedness.",
        "Moreover, four other indicators are newly linked to stativity: (1) Verb frequency, (2) occurrences modified by \"not\" or \"never\", (3) occurrences in the past or present participle, and (4) occurrences in the perfect tense.",
        "Additionally, another three were newly linked to completedness: (1) occurrences modified by a manner adverb, (2) occurrences in the past or present participle, and (3) occurrences in the progressive.",
        "These new correlations can be understood in pragmatic terms.",
        "For example, since points (non-culminated, punctual events, e.g., hiccup) are rare, punctual events are likely to be culminated.",
        "Therefore, an indicator that discriminates events according to extendedness, e.g., the progressive, past/present participle, and duration for-PP, is likely to also discriminate between culminated and non-culminated events.",
        "As a second example, the not/never indicator correlates with stativity in medical reports because diagnoses (i.e., states) are often ruled out in medical discharge summaries, e.g., \"The patient was not hypertensive,\" but procedures (i.e., events) that were not done are not usually mentioned, e.g., '?An examination was not performed.\""
