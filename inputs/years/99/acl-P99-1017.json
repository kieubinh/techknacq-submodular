        "When generating referring expressions (RE), it is generally considered necessary to provide sufficient information so that the reader/hearer is able to identify the intended referent.",
        "A number of broadly related referring expression algorithms have been developed over the past decade based on the natural metaphor of 'ruling out distractors' (Reiter, 1990; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Horacek, 1995).",
        "These special purpose algorithms constitute the 'standard' approach to determining content for RE-generation at this time; they have been developed solely for this purpose and have evolved to meet some specialized problems.",
        "In particular, it was found early on that the most ambitious RE goal – that of always providing the maximally concise referring expression necessary for the context brevity') – is NP-hard; subsequent work on RE-generation has therefore attempted to steer a course between computational tractability and coverage.",
        "One common feature of the favored algorithmic simplifications is their in-crementality: potential descriptions are successively refined (usually non-destructively) to produce the final RE, which therefore may or may not be minimal This is also often motivated on grounds of psychological plausibility.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a completely different metaphor for determining RE-content that may be considered in contrast to, or in combination with, previous approaches.",
        "The main difference lies in an orientation to the organization of a data set as a whole rather than to individual components as revealed during incremental search.",
        "Certain opportunities for concise expression that may otherwise be missed are then effectively isolated.",
        "The approach applies results from the previously unrelated generation task of 'aggregation', which is concerned with the grouping together of structurally related information."

        "Aggregation in generation has hitherto generally consisted of lists of more or less ad hoc, or case-specific rules that group together particular pre-specified configurations (cf. Dalianis and Hovy (1996) and Shaw (1998)); however Bateman et al.",
        "(1998) provide a more rigorous and generic foundation for aggregation by applying results from data-summarization originally developed for multimedia information presentation (Kamps, 1997).",
        "Bateman et al.",
        "set out a general purpose method for constructing aggregation lattices which succinctly represent all possible structural aggregations for any given data set.",
        "The application of the aggregation-based metaphor to RE-content determination is motivated by the observation that if something is a 'potential distractor' for some intended referent, then it is equally, under appropriate conditions, a candidate for aggregation together with the intended referent.",
        "That \"Structural' aggregation refers to opportunities for grouping inherent in the structure of the data and ignoring additional opportunities for grouping that might be found by modifying the data inferentially.",
        "is, what makes something a distractor is precisely the same as that which makes it a potential co-member of some single grouping created by structural aggregation.",
        "To see this, consider the following simple example discussed by Dale and Reiter (1995) consisting of three objects with various properties (re-represented here in a simple association list format):2 (ol (type dog)(size small)(color black)) (o2 (type dog)(size large)(color white)) (o3 (type cat)(size small)(color black)) To successfully refer to the first object o1, sufficient information must be given so as to 'rule out' the possible distractors: therefore, type alone is not sufficient, since this fails to rule out o2, nor is any combination of size or color sufficient, since these fail to rule out o3.",
        "Successful RE's are 'the small dog' or 'the black dog' and not 'the small one', 'the dog', or 'the black one'.",
        "Considering the data set from the aggregation perspective, we ask instead how to refer most succinctly to all of the objects 01, o2, o3.",
        "There are two basic alternatives, indicated by bracketing in the following:3",
        "1.",
        "(A (small black and a large white) dog) and (a small black cat).",
        "2.",
        "(A small black (dog and cat)) and (a large white dog).",
        "The former groups together o1 and o2 on the basis of their shared type, while the latter groups together o1 and o3 on the basis of their shared size and color properties.",
        "Significantly, these are just the possible sources of distraction that Dale and Reiter discuss.",
        "The set of possible aggregations can be determined from an aggregation lattice corresponding to the data set.",
        "We construct the lattice using methods developed in Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) (Wille, 1982).",
        "For the example at hand, the aggregation lattice is built up as follows.",
        "The set of objects is considered as a relation table where the columns represent the object attributes and their values, and the rows",
        "represent the individual objects.",
        "Since the attributes (e.g., 'color', 'size', etc.)",
        "can take multiple values (e.g., 'large', `small'), this representation of the data is called a multivalued context.",
        "This is then converted into a one-valued context by comparing all rows of the table pairwise and, for each attribute (i.e., each column in the table) entering one distinguished value (e.g., T or 1) if the corresponding values of the attributes compared are identical, and another distinguished value (nil or 0) if they are not.",
        "The one-valued context for the objects o1-o3 is thus: object pairs type size color o1-o2 1 0 o1-o3 1 1 o2-o3 0 This indicates that objects o1 and o2 have equal values for their type attribute but otherwise not, while ol and o3 have equal values for both their size and color attributes but not for their type attributes.",
        "The one-valued context readily supports the derivation of formal concepts.",
        "A formal concept is defined in FCA as an extension-intension pair (A, B), where the extension is a subset A of the set of objects and the intension is a subset B of the set of attributes.",
        "For any given concept, each element of the extension must accept all attributes of the intension.",
        "Visually, this corresponds to permuting any rows and columns of the one-valued context and noting all the maximally 'filled' (i.e., containing l's or T's) rectangles.",
        "A csubcon",
        "The main theorem of FCA then shows that <FcA induces a complete lattice structure over the set of formal concepts.",
        "The resulting lattice for the present example is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Each node is shown labeled with two pieces of information: the intension and the extension.",
        "The intensions consist simply of the sets of properties involved.",
        "The representations of the extensions emphasize the function of the nodes in the lattice – i.e., that the indicated objects (e.g., ol and o2 for the leftmost node) are equal with respect to all the attributes contained in the intension (e.g., type for the leftmost node).",
        "(TYPE){COLOR, SIZE) m(ol )=m(o2) m(ol )=m(o3)",
        "This lattice may be construed as an aggregation lattice because the functional redundancies that are captured are precisely those redundances that indicate opportunities for structurally-induced aggregation.",
        "The leftmost node shows that the attribute type may be aggregated if we describe ol together with 02, and the rightmost node shows that {color, size} may be aggregated when describing ol and o3.",
        "Now, given the equivalence between aggregation possibilities and `distractors', we can also use the lattice to drive RE-content determination.",
        "Assume again that we wish to refer to object o 1.",
        "In essence, a combination of attributes must be selected that is not subject to aggregation; any combination susceptible to aggregation will necessarily 'confuse' the objects for which the aggregation holds when only one of the objects, or co-aggregates, is mentioned.",
        "For example, the rightmost node shows that an RE with the content size&color(o1), e.g., 'the small black thing', confuses ol and o3.",
        "To select attributes that are appropriate, we first examine the minimal nodes of the lattice to see if any of these do not 'impinge' (i.e., have no aggregation consequences: we make this more precise below) on the intended referent.",
        "In this case, however, all these nodes do mention ol and so no strong preference for the RE-content is delivered by the data set itself.",
        "This appears to us to be the correct characterization of the reference situation: precisely which attributes are selected should now be determined by factors not attributable to 'distraction' but rather by more general communicative goals involving discourse and the requirements of the particular language.",
        "The resulting attribute combinations are then checked against the aggregation lattice for their referential effectiveness in a manner reminiscent of the incremental approach of previous algorithms Selection of type is not sufficient but the addition of either color or size is (type&color = 1 and type&size=1).",
        "The reference situation is quite different when we wish to refer to either o2 or o3.",
        "For both of these cases there exists a non-impinging node (the right and leftmost nodes respectively).",
        "This establishes immediate attribute preferences based on the organizational properties of the data.",
        "Content-determination for o2 should include at least size or color (`the white thing', 'the large thing') and for o3 at least type (`the cat').",

        "Similarly, and due to the bidirectionality inherent in the subconcept definition, the attribute equalities of node 1 are also 'inherited' upwards both to node 2 and to node 4.",
        "The attribute equalities of node 4 therefore include contributions from both node 1 and node 6.",
        "We will generally indicate in the labeling only the additional information arising from the structure of the lattice, and even then only when it is relevant to the discussion.",
        "So for node 4 we indicate that ol, o5, o6 and o7 now form a single attribute equality set made up of three contributions: one from node 1 (o6 and o7) and two from node 6.",
        "Their combination in a single set is only possible at node 4 because node 4 is a superconcept of both node 1 and node 6.",
        "The other attribute equality set for node 1 (o2 and o3) does not add further information at node 4 and so is left implicit in • node 4's labeling.",
        "The labeling or non-labeling of redundant information has of course no formal consequences for the information contained in the lattice.",
        "To determine RE-content appropriate for referring to object 01, we again look for minimal (i.e., nearest the bottom) concepts, or aggregation sets, that do not 'impinge' on o1.",
        "The only node satisfying this requirement is node 1.",
        "This tells us that the set of possible co-aggregates for o1 with respect to the properties {size & color} is empty, which is equivalent to stating that there are no objects in the data set which might be confused with ol if size&color(ol) forms the RE-content.",

        "Partially to handle such situations, Horacek provides a further related algorithm that is intended to improve on the original and which he illustrates in action with reference to a rather more complex situation involving two tables with a variety of cups and bottles on them.",

        "If we were not to impose this distinction, then referring expressions such as `the table ti' would be seen as appropriate and probably minimal descriptions!5 An aggregation set that does not involve a private attribute will be called a public concept.",
        "The first step in constructing an RE is now to identify the relations/events in which the intended referent is involved – here {g7, g8, g9} – and to specify the positions (both private and public) that the referent holds in these.",
        "We call the set of potentially relevant relations, the reference information source set (Riss).",
        "In the present case, the same argument position is held by the intended referent ti for all Riss-members, i.e., privately arg2 and publicly arg2type.",
        "Next, we proceed as before to",
        "find a non-impinging, minimal aggregate set.",
        "However, we can now define 'non-impinging' more accurately.",
        "A non-impinging node is one for which there is at least one public superconcept fulfilling the following condition: the required superconcept may not bring any RISSnon-member together as co-aggregate with any fuss-member drawn from the originating aggregation set with respect to the specified public attribute of the intended referent.",
        "By these definitions both the minimal nodes of the lattice are non-impinging.",
        "However, node 2 is more supportive of minimal RE's and we will only follow this path here; formal indications of minimality are given by the depth and number of paths leading from the node used for aggregation to the top of the aggregation lattice (since any resulting description then combines discriminatory power from each of its chains of superconcepts) and the number of additional facts that are taken over and above the original Riss-members.",
        "Node 2 is therefore the 'default' choice simply given a requirement of brevity, although the generation process is free to ignore this if other communicative goals so decide.",
        "There are two public superconcepts for node 2: both of nodes 7 and 3 inherit arg2type from node 5 but do not themselves contain a private attribute.",

        "• Rendering these in English would give us: g7 or g8 'the table with a bottle on it' g7 plus g8 'the table with some bottles on it' The precise rendering of the bottles depends on other generator decisions; important here is only the fact that it is known that we do not need to uniquely identify which bottles are in question.",

        "In this way, RE-generation is re-assimilated and seen in a somewhat more general light than previously.",
        "In terms of the implementation and complexity of the approach, it is clear that it cuts the cake rather differently from previous algorithms/approaches.",
        "Some cases of efficient reference may be read-off directly from the lattice; others may require explicit construction and trial of RE-content more reminiscent of the previous algorithms In fact, the aggregation lattice may in such cases be usefully considered in combination with those algorithms, providing an alternative method for checking the consistency of intermediate steps.",
        "Here one important difference between the current approach and previous attempts at maintaining consistency is the reorientation from an incremental procedure to a more static 'overview' of the relationships present, thus providing a promising avenue for the exploration of referring strategies with a wider 'domain of locality'.",
        "This reorientation is also reflected in the differing computational complexity of the approaches: the runtime behavior of the previous algorithms is highly dependent on the final result (number of properties known true of the referent, number of attributes mentioned in the RE), whereas the runtime of the current approach is more closely tied to the data set as a whole, particularly to the number of facts (nd) and the number of attributes (na).",
        "Test runs involving lattice construction for random data sets ranging from 10 to 120 objects, with a number of attributes ranging from 5 to 15 (each with 5-7 possible values) showed that a simple experimental algorithm constructed for uncovering the formal concepts constituting the aggregation lattices had a typical runtime approximately proportional to nani.",
        "Although worst-case behavior for both this and the lattice construction component is substantially slower, there are now efficient standard algorithms and implementations available that mitigate the problem even when manipulating quite sizeable data sets.6 For the sizes of data",
        "sets that occur when considering a RE, time-complexity is not likely to present a problem.",
        "Nevertheless, for larger data sets the approach given here is undoubtedly considerably slower than the simplified algorithms reported both by Dale and Reiter and by Horacek.",
        "However, in contrast to those approaches, it relies only on generic, non-RE specific methods.",
        "The approach also, as suggested above, appears under certain conditions to effectively deliver maximally concise RE's; just what these conditions are and whether they can be systematically exploited remain for future research.",
        "Finally, since the use of aggregation lattices has been argued for other generation tasks (Bateman et al., 1998), some of the 'cost' of deployment may in fact turn out to be shared, making a direct comparison solely with the RE-task in any case inappropriate.",
