        "Syntactic realization grammars have traditionally attempted to accept inputs with the highest possible level of abstraction, in order to facilitate the work of the components (sentence planner) preparing the input.",
        "Recently, the search for higher abstraction has been, however, challenged (Elhadad and Robin, 1996)(Lavoie and Ram-bow, 1997)(Busemann and Horacek, 1998).",
        "In this paper, we contribute to the issue of selecting the \"ideal\" abstraction level in the input to syntactic realization grammar by considering the case of partitives and possessives in a bilingual Hebrew-English generation grammar In the case of bilingual generation, the ultimate goal is to provide a single input structure, where only the open-class lexical entries are specific to the language.",
        "In that case, the minimal abstraction required must cover the different syntactic constraints of the two languages.",
        "We present a contrastive analysis of the syntactic realizations of possessives and partitives in Hebrew and English and conclude by presenting an input specification for complex NPs which is slightly more abstract than the one used in SURGE.",
        "We define two main features – possessor and ref-set and discuss how the grammar handles complex syntactic co-occurrence phenomena based on this input.",

        "One of the first issues to address when selecting a syntactic realization component is whether its input specification language fits the desired application.",
        "Traditionally, syntactic realization components have attempted to raise the abstraction level of input specifications for two reasons: (1) to preserve the possibility of paraphrasing and (2) to make it easy for the sentence planner to map from semantic data to syntactic input As new applications appear, that cannot start generation from a semantic input because such an input is not available (for example regeneration of sentences from syntactic fragments to produce summaries (Barzilay et al., 1999) or generation of complex NPs in a hybrid template system for business letters (Gedalia, 1996)), this motivation has lost some of its strength.",
        "Consequently, \"shallow surface generators\" have recently appeared (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) (Busemann and Horacek, 1998) that require an input considerably less abstract than those required by more traditional realization components such as SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1996) or KPML (Bateman, 1997).",
        "In this paper, we contribute to the debate on selecting an appropriate level of abstraction by considering the case of bilingual generation.",
        "We present results obtained while developing the HUGG syntactic realization component for Hebrew (Dahan-Netzer, 1997).",
        "One of the goals of this system is to design a generator with an input specification language as similar as possible to that of an English generator, SURGE in our case.",

        "Consider the following paraphrase in English for the same input: John gave Mary a book.",
        "The Hebrew grammar does not produce such a paraphrase, as there is no equivalent in Hebrew to the dative move alternation.",
        "In this case, we conclude that the input abstraction level is appropriate.",
        "In contrast, if the input had specified a structure such as indirect-object(prep=to/le, np=Mary), then it would not have been abstract enough to serve as a bilingual input structure.",

        "In addition to possessive, the genitive marker can realize several semantic relations (Quirk et al., 1985) (pp.192-203): subjective genitive (the boy's application – the boy applied) , genitive of origin (the girl's story – the girl told a story), objective genitive, descriptive genitive (a women's college – a college for woman).",
        "As a consequence of this versatility, the general decision of apostrophe vs. of is not trivial: Quirk claims that the higher on the gender scale, i.e., the more animate the noun, the more the possessor realization tends to be realized as an inflected genitive:",

        "This decision also interacts with other realization decisions: if several modifiers must be attached to the same head, they can compete for the same slot in the syntactic structure.",
