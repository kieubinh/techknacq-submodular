        "Statistical methods produce high accuracy results for small number of preselected words.",
        "A lack of widely available semantically tagged corpora almost excludes supervised learning methods.",
        "A possible solution for automatic acquisition of sense tagged corpora has been presented in (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999), but the corpora acquired with this method has not been yet tested for statistical disambiguation of words.",
