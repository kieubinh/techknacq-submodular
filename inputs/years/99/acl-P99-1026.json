        "Building a real-time, interactive spoken dialogue system has long been a dream of researchers, and the recent progress in hardware technology and speech and language processing technologies is making this dream a reality.",
        "It is still hard, however, for computers to understand unrestricted human utterances and respond appropriately to them.",
        "Considering the current level of speech recognition technology, system-initiative dialogue systems, which prohibit users from speaking unrestrictedly, are preferred (Walker et al., 1998).",
        "Nevertheless, we are still pursuing techniques for understanding unrestricted user utterances because, if the accuracy of understanding can be improved, systems that allow users to speak freely could be developed and these would be more useful than systems that do not.",
        "Most previous spoken dialogue systems (e.g. systems by Allen et al.",
        "(1996), Zue et al.",
        "(1994) and Peckham (1993)) assume that the user makes one utterance unit in each speech interval, unless the push-to-talk method is used.",
        "Here, by utterance unit we mean a phrase from which a speech act representation is derived, and it corresponds to a sentence in written language.",
        "We also use speech act in this paper to mean a command that updates the hearer's belief state about the speaker's intention and the context of the dialogue.",
        "In this paper, a system using this assumption is called an interval-based system.",
        "The above assumption no longer holds when no restrictions are placed on the way the user speaks.",
        "This is because utterance boundaries (i.e., semantic boundaries) do not always correspond to pauses and techniques based on other acoustic information are not perfect.",
        "Utterance boundaries thus cannot be identified prior to parsing, and so the timing of determining parsing results to update the belief state is unclear.",
        "On the other hand, responding to a user utterance in real time requires understanding it and updating the belief state in real time; thus, it is impossible to wait for subsequent inputs to determine boundaries.",
        "Abandoning full parsing and adopting keyword-based or fragment-based understanding could prevent this problem.",
        "This would, however, sacrifice the accuracy of understanding because phrases across the pauses could not be syntactically analyzed.",
        "There is, therefore, a need for a method based on full parsing that enables real-time understanding of user utterances without boundary information.",
        "This paper presents incremental significant-utterance-sequence search (ISSS), a method that",
        "enables incremental understanding of user utterances word by word by finding plausible sequences of utterances that play crucial roles in the task execution of dialogues.",
        "The method utilizes beam search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities.",
        "Since it outputs the partial result of understanding that is the most plausible whenever a word hypothesis is inputted, the response generation module can produce responses at any appropriate time.",
        "A comparison of an experimental spoken dialogue system using ISSS with an interval-based system shows that the method is effective."

        "A dilemma is addressed in this paper.",
        "First, it is difficult to identify utterance boundaries in spontaneous speech in real time using only pauses.",
        "Observation of human-human dialogues reveals that humans often put pauses in utterances and sometimes do not put pauses at utterance boundaries.",
        "The following human utterance shows where pauses might appear in an utterance.",
        "I'd like to make a reservation for a conference room (pause) for, uh (pause) this afternoon (pause) at about (pause) say (pause) 2 or 3 o'clock (pause) for (pause) 15 people As far as Japanese is concerned, several studies have pointed out that speech intervals in dialogues are not always well-formed substrings (Seligman et al., 1997; Takezawa and Morimoto, 1997).",
        "On the other hand, since parsing results cannot be obtained unless the end of the utterance is identified, making real-time responses is impossible without boundary information.",
        "For example, consider the utterance \"I'd like to book Meeting Room 1 on Wednesday\".",
        "It is expected that the system should infer the user wants to reserve the room on 'Wednesday this week' if this utterance was made on Monday.",
        "In real conversations, however, there is no guarantee that 'Wednesday' is the final word of the utterance.",
        "It might be followed by the phrase 'next week', in which case the system made a mistake in inferring the user's intention and must backtrack and re-understand.",
        "Thus, it is not possible to determine the interpretation unless the utterance boundary is identified.",
        "This problem is more serious in head-final languages such as Japanese because function words that represent negation come after content words.",
        "Since there is no explicit clue indicating an utterance boundary in unrestricted user utterances, the system cannot make an interpretation and thus cannot respond appropriately.",
        "Waiting for a long pause enables an interpretation, but prevents response in real time.",
        "We therefore need a way to reconcile real-time understanding and analysis without boundary clues."

        "Since these methods are not perfect, the resulting segments do not always correspond to utterances and might not be parsable because of speech recognition errors.",
