        "In query translation, translation ambiguity is a basic problem to be resolved.",
        "A word in a source query may have more than one sense.",
        "Word sense disambiguation identifies the correct sense of each source word, and lexical selection translates it into the corresponding target word.",
        "The above procedure is similar to lexical choice operation in a traditional machine translation (MT) system.",
        "However, there is a significant difference between the applications of MT and CLIR.",
        "In MT, readers interpret the translated results.",
        "If the target word has more than one sense, readers can disambiguate its meaning automatically.",
        "Comparatively, the translated result is sent to a monolingual information retrieval system in CLIR.",
        "The target polysemy adds extraneous senses and affects the retrieval performance.",
        "Some different approaches have been proposed for query translation.",
        "Dictionary-based approach exploits machine-readable dictionaries and selection strategies like select all (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996; Davis, 1997), randomly select N (Ballesteros and Croft, 1996; Kwok 1997) and select best N (Hayashi, Kikui and Susaki, 1997; Davis 1997).",
        "Corpus-based approaches exploit sentence-aligned corpora (Davis and Dunning, 1996) and document-aligned corpora (Sheridan and Ballerini, 1996).",
        "These two approaches are complementary.",
        "Dictionary provides translation candidates, and corpus provides context to fit user intention.",
        "Coverage of dictionaries, alignment performance and domain shift of corpus are major problems of these two approaches.",
        "Hybrid approaches (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Bian and Chen, 1998; Davis 1997) integrate both lexical and corpus knowledge.",
        "All the above approaches deal with the translation ambiguity problem in query translation.",
        "Few touch on translation ambiguity and target polysemy together.",
        "This paper will study the multiplication effects of translation ambiguity and target polysemy in cross-language information retrieval systems, and propose a new translation method to resolve these problems.",

        "That is, \"4414-5-\" (yin2hang2) is sent into an IR system, and then documents containing \"4-1-\" (yin2hang2) will be presented.",
        "In this example, translation disambiguation should be done rather than target polysemy resolution.",
        "The above examples do not mean translation disambiguation is not required in CEIR.",
        "Some Chinese words may have more than one sense.",

        "This disambiguation method performs good translations even when the multi-term phrases are not found in the bilingual dictionary, or the phrases are not identified in the source language.",

        "Consider the Chinese query \"ip..4-1--\" (yin2hang2) to an English collection again.",
        "The ambiguity grows from none (source side) to 9 senses (target side) during query translation.",
        "How to incorporate the knowledge from source side to target side is an important issue.",
        "To avoid the problem of target polysemy in query",
        "translation, we have to restrict the use of a target word by augmenting some other words that usually co-occur with it.",
        "That is, we have to make a context for the target word.",
        "In our method, the contextual information is derived from the source word.",
        "We collect the frequently accompanying nouns and verbs for each word in a Chinese corpus.",
        "Those words that co-occur with a given word within a window are selected.",
        "The word association strength of a word and its accompanying words is measured by mutual information.",

        "EW1, EW2, ..., and EWn, form an augmented translation restriction of E for C. In other words, the list (E, EW1, EW2, EW„,) is called an augmented translation result for C. EW„ EW2, ..., and EWm are a pseudo English context produced from Chinese side.",
        "Consider the Chinese word \"itt.tt\" (yin2hang2).",
        "Some strongly co-related Chinese words in ROCLING balanced corpus (Huang, et al., 1995) are: \"ROC (tielxian4), \"4k \" (ling3chul), 4'7\" (1i3ang2), \"417Li\" (yal hui4), 3t,\" (hui4dui4), etc.",
