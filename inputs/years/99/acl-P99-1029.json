        "For cross-language IR, either queries or documents are translated to overcome the language differences.",
        "Although it is possible to apply a high-quality machine translation system for documents as in Oard & Hackett (1997), query translation has emerged as a more popular method because it is much simpler and more economical compared to document translation.",
        "Query translation can be done in one or more of the three approaches: a dictionary-based approach, a thesaurus-based approach, or a corpus-based approach.",
        "There are three problems that a cross-language IR system using a query translation method must solve (Grefenstette, 1998).",
        "The first problem is to figure out how a term expressed in one language might be written in another.",
        "The second problem is to determine which of the possible translations should be retained.",
        "The third problem is to determine how to properly weight the importance of translation alternatives when more than one is retained.",
        "For cross-language IR between Korean and English, i.e. between Korean queries and English documents, an easy way to handle query translation is to use a Korean-English machine-readable dictionary (MRD) because such bilingual MRDs are more widely available than other resources such as parallel corpora.",
        "However, it has been known that with a simple use of bilingual dictionaries in other language pairs, retrieval effectiveness can be only 40%- 60% of that with monolingual retrieval (Ballesteros & Croft, 1997).",
        "It is obvious that other additional resources need to be used for better performance.",
        "This paper focuses on the last two problems: pruning translations and calculating the weights for translation alternatives.",
        "We first describe the overall query translation process and the extent to which the ambiguity problem arises in Korean-English cross-language IR.",
        "We then propose a relatively simple yet effective method for resolving translation disambiguation using mutual information (MI) (Church and Hanks, 1990) statistics obtained only from the target document collection.",

        "Without the tagger, all the extraneous candidate keywords generated from the morphological analyzer will have to be entered into the translation process, which in and of itself will generate extraneous words, due to one-to-many mapping in the bilingual dictionary."

        "Although an easy way to find translations of query terms is to use a bilingual dictionary, this method alone suffers from problems caused by translation ambiguity since there are often one-to-many correspondences in a bilingual dictionary.",

        "Retaining multiple candidate words can be useful in promoting recall in monolingual IR system, but previous research indicates that failure to disambiguate the meanings of the words can hurt retrieval effectiveness tremendously.",
        "For instance, it is obvious that a phrase like empty vessel would change the meaning of the query entirely.",
        "Even a word like contamination, a synonym of pollution, may end up retrieving unrelated documents due to the slight differences in meaning.",

        "The left half shows the average number of English words per Korean word for each query, whereas the right half shows the average number of word pairs in English that can be formed from a single word pair in Korean.",

        "Second, there may be more than one strong association whose degrees are different from each other by a large magnitude.",
        "Third, seemingly extraneous terms may serve as a recall-enhancing device with a query expansion effect.",
        "The basic idea in our term weighting scheme is to give a large weight to the best candidate and divide the remaining quantity to assign equal weights to the rest of the candidates.",
        "In other words, the weight for the best candidate, W,„ is either 1 if it is greater than a threshold value or expressed as follows.",
        "Here x and 0 are a MI value and a threshold, respectively.",
        "The numerator, f(x), gives the smallest integer greater than the MI value so that the resulting weight is the same for all the candidates whose MI values are within a certain interval.",

        "where n is the number of candidates.",

        "In the example of Fig. 2, the word pair candidate between wl and w2 are (motorcar, air), (automobile, air), and (car, air).",
