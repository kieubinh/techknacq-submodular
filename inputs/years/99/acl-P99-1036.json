        "About the same accuracy is reported in Chinese by statistical methods (Sproat et al., 1996).",
        "But there has been relatively little improvement in recent years because most of the remaining errors are due to unknown words.",
        "There are two approaches to solve this problem: to increase the coverage of the dictionary (Fung and Wu, 1994; Chang et al., 1995; Mori and Naga.o, 1996) and to design a better model for unknown words (Nagata, 1996; Sproat et al., 1996).",
        "We take the latter approach.",
        "To improve word segmentation accuracy, (Nagata, 1996) used a single general purpose unknown word model, while (Sproat et al., 1996) used a set of specific word models such as for plurals, personal names, and transliterated foreign words.",
        "The goal of our research is to assign a correct part of speech to unknown word as well as identifying it correctly.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel statistical model for Japanese unknown words.",

        "We present a statistical model of Japanese unknown words using word morphology and word context.",
        "We find that Japanese words are better modeled by classifying words based on the character sets (kanji, hiragana, katakana, etc.)",
        "and its changes.",
        "This is because the different character sets behave differently in many ways (historical etymology, ideogram vs. phonogram, etc.).",
        "Both word segmentation accuracy and part of speech tagging accuracy are improved by treating them differently."
