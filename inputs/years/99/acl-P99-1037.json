        "Morphological analysis is an essential component in language engineering applications ranging from spelling error correction to machine translation.",
        "Performing a full morphological analysis of a wordform is usually regarded as a segmentation of the word into morphemes, combined with an analysis of the interaction of these morphemes that determine the syntactic class of the wordform as a whole.",
        "The complexity of wordform morphology varies widely among the world's languages, but is regarded quite high even in the relatively simple cases, such as English.",
        "Many wordforms in English and other western languages contain ambiguities in their morphological composition that can be quite intricate.",
        "General classes of linguistic knowledge that are usually assumed to play a role in this disambiguation process are knowledge of (i) the morphemes of a language, (ii) the morphotac-tics, i.e., constraints on how morphemes are allowed to attach, and (iii) spelling changes that can occur due to morpheme attachment.",
        "State-of-the art systems for morphological analysis of wordforms are usually based on two-level finite-state transducers (FSTS, Kosken-niemi (1983)).",
        "Even with the availability of sophisticated development tools, the cost and complexity of hand-crafting two-level rules is high, and the representation of concatenative compound morphology with continuation lexicons is difficult.",
        "As in parsing, there is a trade-off between coverage and spurious ambiguity in these systems: the more sophisticated the rules become, the more needless ambiguity they introduce.",
        "In this paper we present a learning approach which models morphological analysis (including compounding) of complex wordforms as sequences of classification tasks.",
        "Our model, MBMA (Memory-Based Morphological Analysis), is a memory-based learning system (Stan-fill and Waltz, 1986; Daelemans et al., 1997).",
        "Memory-based learning is a class of inductive, supervised machine learning algorithms that learn by storing examples of a task in memory.",
        "Computational effort is invested on a \"call-by-need\" basis for solving new examples (henceforth called instances) of the same task.",
        "When new instances are presented to a memory-based learner, it searches for the best-matching instances in memory, according to a task-dependent similarity metric.",
        "When it has found the best matches (the nearest neighbors), it transfers their solution (classification, label) to the new instance.",
        "Memory-based learning has been shown to be quite adequate for various natural-language processing tasks such as stress assignment (Daelemans et al., 1994), grapheme â€“ phoneme conversion (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1996; Van den Bosch, 1997), and part-of-speech tagging (Daelemans et al., 1996b).",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, we give a brief overview of Dutch morphology in Section 2.",
        "We then turn to a description of MBMA in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we present",
        "the experimental outcomes of our study with MBMA.",

        "The processes of Dutch morphology include inflection, derivation, and compounding.",
        "Inflection of verbs, adjectives, and nouns is mostly achieved by suffixation, but a circum-fix also occurs in the Dutch past participle (e.g. ge+werk+t as the past participle of verb werken, to work).",
        "Irregular inflectional morphology is due to relics of ablaut (vowel change) and to suppletion (mixing of different roots in inflectional paradigms).",
        "Processes of derivation in Dutch morphology occur by means of prefixation and suffixation.",
        "Derivation can change the syntactic class of wordforms.",
        "Compounding in Dutch is concatenative (as in German and Scandinavian languages): words can be strung together almost unlimitedly, with only a few morphotactic constraints, e.g., rechtsinformaticatoepassingen (applications of computer science in Law).",
        "In general, a complex wordform inherits its syntactic properties from its rightmost part (the head).",
        "Several spelling changes occur: apart from the closed set of spelling changes due to irregular morphology, a number of spelling changes is predictably due to morphological context.",
        "The spelling of long vowels varies between double and single (e.g. ik loop, I run, versus wij lop+en, we run); the spelling of root-final consonants can be doubled (e.g. ik stop, I stop, versus wij stopp+en, we stop); there is variation between s and z and f and v (e.g. huis, house, versus huizen, houses).",
        "Finally, between the parts of a compound, a linking morpheme may appear (e.g. staat+s+loterij, state lottery).",
        "For a detailed discussion of morphological phenomena in Dutch, see De Haas and Trommelen (1993).",
        "Previous approaches to Dutch morphological analysis have been based on finite-state transducers (e.g., XEROX'es morphological an-alyzer), or on parsing with context-free word grammars interleaved with exploration of possible spelling changes (e.g. Heemskerk and van Heuven (1993); or see Heemskerk (1993) for a probabilistic variant)."

        "(Daelemans, 1995).",
        "This is also the case for morphological analysis.",
        "Memory-based learning algorithms can learn mappings (classifications) if a sufficient number of instances of these mappings is presented to them.",
        "We drew our instances from the CELEX lexical data base (Baayen et al., 1993).",
        "CELEX contains a large lexical data base of Dutch wordforms, and features a full morphological analysis for 247,415 of them.",
        "We took each wordform and its associated analysis, and created task instances using a windowing method (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987).",
        "Windowing transforms each wordform into as many instances as it has letters.",
        "Each example focuses on one letter, and includes a fixed number of left and right neighbor letters, chosen here to be five.",
        "Consequently, each instance spans eleven letters, which is also the average word length in the CELEX data base.",
        "Moreover, we estimated from exploratory data analysis that this context would contain enough information to allow for adequate disambiguation.",
        "To illustrate the construction of instances, Table 1 displays the 15 instances derived from the Dutch example word abnormaliteiten (abnormalities) and their associated classes.",
        "The class of the first instance is \"A+Da\", which says that (i) the morpheme starting in a is an adjective (\"A\")1, and (ii) an a was deleted at the end (\"+Da\").",
        "The coding thus tells that the first morpheme is the adjective abnormaal.",

        "This way we generated an instance base of 2,727,462 10ELEX features ten syntactic tags: noun (N), adjective (A), quantifier/numeral (Q), verb (V), article (D), pronoun (0), adverb (B), preposition (P), conjunction (C), interjection (J), and abbreviation (X).",

        "Most class labels combine a syntactic or inflectional tag with a spelling change, and generally have a low frequency.",
        "When a wordform is listed in CELEX as having more than one possible morphological labeling (e.g., a morpheme may be N or V, the inflection en may be plural for nouns or infinitive for verbs), these labels are joined into ambiguous classes (\"N/V\") and the first generated example is labeled with this ambiguous class.",
        "Ambiguity in syntactic and inflectional tags occurs in 3.6% of all morphemes in our CELEX data.",
        "The memory-based learning algorithm used within MBMA is n31-IG (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992; Daelemans et al., 1997), an extension of IB 1 (Aha et al., 1991).",
        "IB1-IG constructs a data base of instances in memory during learning.",
        "New instances are classified by ff31-IG by matching them to all instances in the instance base, and calculating with each match the distance between the new instance â€¢X and the memory instance Y, A(X, Y) = E7i1_1 W(fi)(5(xi, yi), where W( f i) is the weight of the ith feature, and 8(x2, yi) is the distance between the values of the ith feature in instances X and Y.",
        "When the values of the instance features are symbolic, as with our linguistic tasks, the simple overlap distance function is used: 6(x1, y2) 0 if x, = yi, else 1.",
        "The (most frequently occurring) classification of the memory instance Y with the smallest X, Y) is then taken as the classification of X.",
        "The weighting function W(f2) computes for each feature, over the full instance base, its information gain, a function from information theory; cf. Quinlan (1986).",
        "In short, the information gain of a feature expresses its relative importance compared to the other features in performing the mapping from input to classification.",
        "When information gain is used in the similarity function, instances that match on important features are regarded as more alike than instances that match on unimportant features.",
        "In our experiments, we are primarily interested in the generalization accuracy of trained models, i.e., the ability of these models to use their accumulated knowledge to classify new instances that were not in the training material.",

        "We have demonstrated the applicability of memory-based learning to morphological analysis, by reformulating the problem as a classification task in which letter sequences are classified as marking different types of morpheme boundaries.",
        "The generalization performance of memory-based learning algorithms to the task is encouraging, given that the tests are done on held-out (dictionary) words.",
        "Estimates of free-text performance give indications of high accuracies: 84.6% correct fully-analyzed words (64.6% on unseen words), and 96.7% correctly segmented and coarsely-labeled words (about 90% for unseen words).",
        "Precision and recall of fully-labeled morphemes is estimated in real texts to be over 93% (about 84% for unseen words).",
        "Finally, the prediction of (possibly ambiguous) syntactic classes of unknown wordforms in the test material was shown to be 91.2% correct; the corresponding free-text estimate is 97.2% correctly-tagged wordforms.",
        "In comparison with the traditional approach, which is not immune to costly hand-crafting and spurious ambiguity, the memory-based learning approach applied to a reformulation of the problem as a classification task of the segmentation type, has a number of advantages:",
        "â€¢ it presupposes no more linguistic knowledge than explicitly present in the corpus used for training, i.e., it avoids a knowledge-acquisition bottleneck; â€¢ it is language-independent, as it functions on any morphologically analyzed corpus in any language; â€¢ learning is automatic and fast; â€¢ processing is deterministic, non-recurrent",
        "(i.e., it does not retry analysis generation) and fast, and is only linearly related to the length of the wordform being processed.",
        "The language-independence of the approach can be illustrated by means of the following partial results on MBMA of English.",
        "We performed experiments on 75,745 English wordforms from CELEX and predicted the lower-granularity tasks of predicting morpheme boundaries (Van den Bosch et al., 1996).",
        "Experiments yielded 88.0% correctly segmented test words when deciding only on the location of morpheme boundaries, and 85.6% correctly segmented test words discerning between derivational and inflectional morphemes.",
        "Both results are roughly comparable to the 90% reported here (but note the difference in training set size).",
        "A possible limitation of the approach may be the fact that it cannot return more than one possible segmentation for a wordform.",
        "E.g. the compound word Icwartslagen can be interpreted as either kwart+slagen (quarter turns) or kvvarts+lagen (quartz layers).",
        "The memory-based approach would select one segmentation.",
        "However, true segmentation ambiguity of this type is very rare in Dutch.",
        "Labeling ambiguity occurs more often (3.6% of all morphemes), and the current approach simply produces ambiguous tags.",
        "However, it is possible for our approach to return distributions of possible classes, if desired, as well as it is possible to \"unpack\" ambiguous labeling into lists of possible morphological analyses of a wordform.",
        "If, for example, MBMA's output for the word bakken (bake, an infinitive or plural verb form, or bins, a plural noun) would be [bak]riAr[en]invon, then this output could be expanded unambiguously into the noun analysis [bak]N[en],, (plural) and the two verb readings [bak]v[en] (infinitive) and [bak]r[en]tin (present tense plural).",
        "Points of future research are comparisons with other morphological analyzers and lem-matizers; applications of MBMA to other languages (particularly those with radically different morphologies); and qualitative analyses of MBMA's output in relation with linguistic predictions of errors and markedness of exceptions."
