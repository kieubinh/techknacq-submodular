        "where every man loves a (possibly) different woman, or",
        "where a single woman is loved by every man.",
        "One aspect of the problem is the generation of all available readings in a suitable representation language.",
        "Cooper (1983) described a system of \"storing\" the quantifiers as A-expressions during the parsing process and retrieving them at the sentence level; different orders of quantifier retrieval generate different readings of the sentence.",
        "However, Cooper's method generates logical forms in which variables are not correctly bound by their quantifiers, and so do not correspond to a correct sentence meaning.",
        "This problem is rectified by nested storage (Keller, 1986) and the Hobbs and Shieber (1987) algorithm.",
        "However, the linguistic assumptions underlying these approaches have recently been questioned.",
        "Park (1995) has argued that the availability of readings is determined not by the well-formedness of sentences in the meaning language, but by the function-argument relationships within the sentence.",
        "His theory proposes that only a subset of the well-formed sentences generated by nested storage are available to a speaker of English.",
        "Although the theories have different generative power, it is difficult to find linguistic data that convincingly proves either theory correct.",
        "In the absence of persuasive linguistic data, it is reasonable to ask whether other grounds exist for choosing to work with either of the two theories.",
        "This paper considers the application of both theories to the problem of underspecified meaning representation, and the question of determining whether a set of constraints represents an available reading of an ambiguous sentence or not.",
        "We show that a constraint language based upon Park's linguistic theory (Willis and Manandhar, 1999) solves this problem in polynomial time, and contrast this with recent work based on dominance constraints which shows that using the more permissive theory of availability to solve the same problems leads to NP-hardness."

        "We shall characterise the desirable properties of an underspecified meaning representation as:",
        "1. the meaning of a sentence should be represented in a way that is not committed to any one of the possible (intended) meanings of the sentence, and 2. it should be possible to incrementally introduce partial information about the meaning, if such information is available, and without the need to undo work that has already been done.",
        "A principal aim of systems providing an underspecified representation of quantifier scope is the ability to represent partial scopings.",
        "That is, it should be possible to state that some of the quantifiers have some scope relative to each other, while remaining uncommitted to the relative scope of the remaining quantifiers.",
        "However, representations which simply allow partial scopes to be stated without further analysis do not adequately capture the behaviour of quantifiers in a sentence.",

        "where the list of quantifier labels indicates the relative scope of quantifiers at that point in the sentence.",
        "Although this formula is well formed in the QLF language, it does not correspond to a well formed sentence of logic, seeming closer to the formula: every(x,rep.of(x,y), most(z,sample(z), exists(y, co(y), see(x, z)))) where the variable y does not appear in the scope of its quantifier.",
        "A language such as QLF will generally allow this scoping to be expressed, even though it does not correspond to a reading available to a speaker.",
        "In QLF semantics, a scoping which does not give rise to any well formed readings is considered \"uninterpretable\" ; ie.",
        "there is no interpretation in which an evaluation function maps the QLF onto a truth value.",
        "Our aim is to present a system in which there is a straightforward computational test of whether a well-formed reading of a sentence exists in which a partial scoping is satisfied, without requiring recourse to the final logical form.",
        "The language CLLS (Egg et al., 1998) has recently been developed which correctly generates the well-formed readings by using dominance constraints over trees.",
        "Readings of a sentence can be represented using a tree, where dominance represents outscoping, and quantifiers are represented using binary trees whose daughters correspond to the quantifiers' restriction and scope.",
        "So for the current example, Every representative of a company saw most samples, the reading:",
        "can be represented by the tree in figure 1, where the restrictions of a and most have been omitted for clarity.",
        "Domination in the tree represents outscoping in the logical form.",
        "Underspecification can be captured by defining dominance constraints between nodes representing the quantifiers and relations in a sentence.",
        "Readings of the sentence with a free variable are avoided by asserting that each relation containing a variable must be dominated by that variable's quantifier, and an available reading of the sentence is represented by a tree in which all the dominance constraints are satisfied.",
        "So the ill-formed readings of the sentence can be avoided by stating that the relation rep. of is dominated by the restriction of every and the scope of a, while see is dominated by the scopes of both a and most.",
        "This is represented in figure 2, where the dominance constraints are illustrated by dotted lines.",
        "Further partial scope information can be introduced with additional dominance constraints.",
        "So the partial scope requirement that",
        "most should outscope every would be captured by a constraint stating that the node representing most should dominate the node representing every in the constraints' solution.",
        "It is has been shown (Koller et al., 1998) that determining the consistency of these constraints is NP-hard.",

        "To represent relative scope between arbitrary quantifiers in the sentence, a further transitive relation, >, is defined.",
        "Say that if (S,>-) is a strictly partially ordered set in the structure where x, y E S and x y then x> y.",
        "So for example, consider the pair of strictly partially ordered sets: *very, most, see} , (every >- most >- see)) ({every, a, of , (a >2 every >2 of)) which would represent the reading (in a format similar to generalised quantifiers): a(y, co(y), every(x,rep.of (x, y), most(z, sample(z), see(x, z)))) The orders on the sets state that every>most> see and a > every > of, and from the transitivity of > it can be inferred (correctly) that a > most.",
        "Similarly, given the ambiguous sentence and the partial scope requirement that a should outscope most, the required partial scope can be obtained by adding the relations a >2 every and every >- most.",

        "A desirable property for an underspecified representation of quantifier scope ambiguity is that there should be a computationally efficient test for whether a partial scope is available or not.",
        "We have shown that accepting a theory of availability which states that scope availability is determined by the function-argument structure of a sentence allows the development of a test for availability which is polynomial in the number of quantifiers and relations in a sentence, while theories of availability based upon the logical well-formedness of meaning representations has been shown to be NP-hard.",
