        "Discourse tagging is studied mainly from two different viewpoints, i.e., linguistic and engineering viewpoints.",
        "The work described here belongs to the latter group.",
        "More specifically, we are interested in automatically recognizing the speech act types of utterances and in applying them to speech translation systems.",
        "Several studies on discourse tagging to date have been motivated by engineering applications.",
        "The early studies by Nagata and Morimoto (1994) and Reithinger and Maier (1995) showed the possibility of predicting dialogue act tags for next utterances with statistical methods.",
        "These studies, however, presupposed properly segmented utterances, which is not a realistic assumption.",
        "In contrast to this assumption, automatic utterance segmentation (or discourse segmentation) is desired here.",
        "Discourse segmentation in linguistics, whether manual or automatic, has also received keen attention because such segmentation provides the foundation of higher discourse structures (Grosz and Sid-ner, 1986).",
        "Discourse segmentation has also received keen attention from the engineering side because the natural language processing systems that follow the speech recognition system are designed to accept linguistically meaningful units (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996).",
        "There has been a lot of research following this line such as (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996) (Cet-tolo and Falavigna, 1998), to only mention a few.",
        "We can take advantage of these studies as a pre-process for tagging.",
        "In this paper, however, we propose a statistical tagging system that optimally performs segmentation and tagging at the same time.",
        "Previous studies like (Litman and Passonneau, 1995) have pointed out that the use of a multiple information source can contribute to better segmentation and tagging, and so our statistical model integrates linguistic, acoustic and situational information.",
        "The problem can be formalized as a search problem on a word graph, which can be efficiently handled by an extended dynamic programming algorithm.",
        "Actually, we can efficiently find the optimal solution without limiting the search space at all.",
        "The results of our tagging experiments involving both Japanese and English corpora indicated a high performance for Japanese but a considerably lower performance for the English corpora.",
        "This work also reports on the use of speech act type tags for translating Japanese and English positive response expressions.",
        "Positive responses quite often appear in task – oriented dialogues like those in our tasks.",

        "We discuss the tagging work in this section.",
        "In subsection 5.3, we showed that Japanese segmentation into SA units was quite successful only with lexical information, but English segmentation was not that successful.",
        "Although we do not know of any experiments directly comparable to ours, a recent work reported by Cettolo and Falavigna (1998) seems to be similar.",
        "In that paper, they worked on finding semantic boundaries in Italian dialogues with the \"appointment scheduling task.\" Their semantic boundary nearly corresponds to our SA unit boundary.",
        "Cettolo and Falavigna (1998) reported recall and precision rates of 62.8% and 71.8%, respectively, which were obtained with insertion and deletion of boundary markers.",
        "These scores are clearly lower than our results with a Japanese segmentation match.",
        "Although we should not jump to a generalization, we are tempted to say the Japanese dialogues are easier to segment than western languages.",
        "With this in mind, we would like to discuss our study.",
        "First of all, was the manual segmentation quality the same for both corpora?",
        "As we explained in subsection 2.1, both corpora were tagged by experts, and the entire result was checked by one of them for each language.",
        "Therefore, we believe that there was not such a significant gap in quality that could explain the segmentation performance.",
        "Secondly, which lexical information yielded such a performance gap?",
        "We investigated the effects of part – of – speech and morphemes in the segmentation",
        "of both languages.",
        "We conducted the same 10 – fold cross – validation tests as in sub – section 5.3 and obtained 82.29% (recall) and 86.16% (precision) for Japanese under condition (B'), which used only pos's in 4+12 for the PE calculation.",
        "English, in contrast, marked rates of 65.63% (recall) and 73.35% (precision) under the same condition.",
        "These results indicated the outstanding effectiveness of Japanese pos's in segmentation.",
        "Actually, we could see some pos's such as \"ending particle (shu-jyoshi)\" which clearly indicate sentence endings and we considered that they played important roles in the segmentation.",
        "English, on the other hand, did not seem to have such strong segment indicating pos's. Although lexical information is important in English segmentation (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996), what other information can help improve such segmentation?",
        "Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) showed that prosodic information helps human discourse segmentation.",
        "Litman and Passonneau (1995) addressed the usefulness of a \"multiple knowledge source\" in human and automatic discourse segmentation.",
        "Venditti and Swerts (1996) stated that the intonational features for many Indo – European languages help cue the structure of spoken discourse.",
        "Cettolo and Falavigna (1998) reported improvements in Italian semantic boundary detection with acoustic information.",
        "All of these works indicate that the use of acoustic or prosodic information is useful, so this is surely one of our future directions.",
        "The use of higher syntactical information is also one of our directions.",
        "The SA unit should be a meaningful syntactic unit, although its degree of meaningfulness may be less than that in written texts.",
        "The goodness of this aspect can be easily incorporated in our probability term PE."

        "We have described a new efficient statistical speech act type tagging system based on a statistical model used in Japanese morphological analyzers.",
        "This system integrates linguistic, acoustic, and situational features and efficiently performs optimal segmentation of a turn and tagging.",
        "From several tagging experiments, we showed that the system segmented turns and assigned speech act type tags at high accuracy rates when using Japanese data.",
        "Comparatively lower performance was obtained using English data, and we discussed the performance difference.",
        "We also examined the effect of parameters in the statistical models on tagging performance.",
        "We finally showed that the SA tags in this paper are useful in translating positive responses that often appear in task – oriented dialogues such as those in ours."
