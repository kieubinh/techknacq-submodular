        "In the domain of corpus-based terminology, there are two main topics of research: term acquisition – the discovery of candidate terms – and automatic thesaurus construction – the addition of semantic links to a term bank.",

        "On the other hand, contributions to automatic construction of thesauri provide classes or links between single words.",
        "Classes are produced by clustering techniques based on similar word contexts (Schiitze, 1993) or similar distributional contexts (Grefenstette, 1994).",

        "Predicative patterns yield predicative relations such as cause or effect whereas discursive patterns yield non-predicative relations such as generic/specific or synonymy links.",

        "It has produced 15,875 multi-word terms composed of 4,194 single words.",
        "For expository purposes, some examples are taken from [MEDIC], a 1.56- million word English corpus of scientific abstracts in the medical domain.",
        "The main contribution of this article is to bridge the gap between term acquisition and thesaurus construction by offering a framework for organizing multi-word candidate terms with the help of automatically acquired links between single-word terms.",
        "Through the extraction of semantic variants, the semantic links between single words are projected on multi-word candidate terms.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, the input to the system is a tagged corpus.",

        "In a second step, layered hierarchies of multi-word terms are constructed through corpus-based conflation of semantic variants.",
