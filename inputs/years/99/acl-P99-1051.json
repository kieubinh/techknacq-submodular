        "Levin (1993) assumes that the syntactic realization of a verb's arguments is directly correlated with its meaning (cf. also Pinker (1989) for a similar proposal).",
        "Thus one would expect verbs that undergo the same alternations to form a semantically coherent class.",
        "Levin's study on diathesis alternations has influenced recent work on word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996), machine translation (Dang et al., 1998), and automatic lexical acquisition (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Schulte im Walde, 1998).",
        "The objective of this paper is to investigate the extent to which diathesis alternations are empirically attested in corpus data.",
        "Using the dative and benefactive alternations as a test case we attempt to determine: (a) if some alternations are more frequent than others, (b) if alternating verbs have frame preferences and (c) what the representative members of an alternation are.",

        "(e.g., WordNet).",
        "We have shown that corpus frequencies can be used to quantify linguistic intuitions and lexical generalizations such as Levin's (1993) semantic classification.",
        "Furthermore, corpus frequencies can make explicit predictions about word use.",
        "This was demonstrated by using the frequencies to estimate the productivity of an alternation for a given semantic class and the typicality of its members."
