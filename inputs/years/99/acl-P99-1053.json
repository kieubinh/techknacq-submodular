      "text": [
        "The parsers used in most dialog systems have not evolved much past their origins in handling written text even though they may have to deal with speech repairs, speakers collaborating to form utterances, and speakers interrupting each other.",
        "This is especially true of machine translators and meeting analysis programs that deal with human-human dialog.",
        "Speech recognizers have started to adapt to spoken dialog (versus read speech).",
        "Recent language models (Heeman and Allen, 1997), (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996), (Siu and Ostendorf, 1996) take into account the fact that word co-occurrences may be disrupted by editing termsl and speech repairs (take the tanker I mean the boxcar).",
        "These language models detect repairs as they process the input; however, like past work on speech repair detection, they do not 'Here, we define editing terms as a set of 30-40 words that signal hesitations (um) and speech repairs (I mean) and give meta-comments on the utterance (right).",
        "specify how speech repairs should be handled by the parser.",
        "(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration.",
        "(Hindle, 1983) states that repairs are available for semantic analysis but provides no details on the representation to be used.",
        "Clearly repairs should be available for semantic analysis as they play a role in dialog structure.",
        "For example, repairs can contain referents that are needed to interpret subsequent text: have the engine take the oranges to Elmira, um, I mean, take them to Corning.",
        "(Brennan and Williams, 1995) discusses the role of fillers (a type of editing term) in expressing uncertainty and (Schober, 1999) describes how editing terms and speech repairs correlate with planning difficultly.",
        "Clearly this is information that should be conveyed to higher-level reasoning processes.",
        "An additional advantage to making the parser aware of speech repairs is that it can use its knowledge of grammar and the syntactic structure of the input to correct errors made in pre-parser repair identification.",
        "Like Hindle's work, the parsing architecture presented below uses phrase structure to represent the corrected utterance, but it also forms a phrase structure tree containing the reparandum.",
        "Editing terms are considered separate utterances that occur inside other utterances.",
        "So for the partial utterance, take the ban um the oranges, three constituents would be produced, one for um, another for take the ban-, and a third for take the oranges.",
        "Another complicating factor of dialog is",
        "the presence of more than one speaker.",
        "This paper deals with the two speaker case, but the principles presented should apply generally.",
        "Sometimes the second speaker needs to be treated independently as in the case of backchannels (um-hm) or failed attempts to grab the floor.",
        "Other times, the speakers interact to collaboratively form utterances or correct each other.",
        "The next step in language modeling will be to decide whether speakers are collaborating or whether a second speaker is interrupting the context with a repair or backchannel.",
        "Parsers must be able to form phrase structure trees around interruptions such as backchannels as well as treat interruptions as continuations of the first speaker's input.",
        "This paper presents a parser architecture that works with a speech repair identifying language model to handle speech repairs, editing terms, and two speakers.",
        "Section 2 details the allowable forms of collaboration, interruption, and speech repair in our model.",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of how this model is implemented in a parser.",
        "This topic is explored in more detail in (Core and Schubert, 1998).",
        "Section 4 discusses the applicability of the model to a test corpus, and section 5 includes examples of trees output by the parser.",
        "Section 6 discusses the results of using the parser to correct the output of a pre-parser speech repair identifier."

        "Such a view either disallows editing terms, repairs, interjected acknowledgments and other disruptions, or else breaks semantically complete utterances into fragmentary ones.",
        "We analyze dialog in terms of a set of utterances covering all the words of the dialog.",
        "As explained below, utterances can be formed by more than one speaker and the words of two utterances may be interleaved.",

        "We form two interpretations of an utterance with a speech repair.",
        "One interpretation includes all of the utterance up to the reparandum end but stops at that point; this is what the speaker started to say, and will likely be an incomplete utterance.",
        "The second interpretation is the corrected utterance and skips the reparandum.",
        "In the example, you should take the boxcar I mean the tanker to Corning; the reparandum is the boxcar.",

        "These copies are extended to the current change of speaker.",

        "In the example below, consider change of speaker (cos) 2.",
        "Copies of all phrase hypotheses ending at change of speaker 1 are extended to end at change of speaker 2.",
        "In this way, speaker A can form a phrase from contr-1 and contr-3 skipping speaker B's interruption, or contr-1, contr-2, and contr-3 can all form one constituent.",
        "At change of speaker 3, all phrase hypotheses ending at change of speaker 2 are extended to end at change of speaker 3 except those hypotheses that were extended from the previous change of speaker.",
        "Thus, an utterance cannot be formed from only contr-1 and contr-4.",
        "This mechanism implements the rules for speaker changes given in section 2: at each change of speaker, the new speaker can either build on the last contribution, build on their last contribution, or start a new utterance.",
        "These rules assume that changes of speaker are well defined points of time, meaning that words of two speakers do not overlap.",
        "In the experiments of this paper, a corpus was used where word endings were timestamped (word beginnings are unavailable).",
        "These times were used to impose an ordering; if one word ends before another it is counted as being before the other word.",
        "Clearly, this could be inaccurate given that words may overlap.",
        "Moreover, speakers may be slow to interrupt or may anticipate the first speaker and interrupt early.",
        "However, this approximation works fairly well as discussed in section 4.",
        "Other parts of the implementation are accomplished through metarules.",
        "The term metarule is used because these rules act not on words but grammar rules.",
        "Consider the editing term metarule.",
        "When an editing term is seen2, the metarule extends copies of all phrase hypotheses ending at the editing term over that term to allow utterances to be formed around it.",
        "This metarule (and our other metarules) can be viewed declaratively as specifying allowable patterns of phrase breakage and interleaving (Core and Schubert, 1998).",
        "This notion is different from the traditional linguistic conception of metarules as rules for generating new PSRs from given PSRs.3 Procedurally, we can think of metarules as creating new (discontinuous) pathways for the parser's traversal of the input, and this view is readily implement able.",
        "The repair metarule, when given the hypothetical start and end of a reparandum (say from a language model such as (Heeman and Allen, 1997)), extends copies of phrase hypotheses over the reparandum allowing the corrected utterance to be formed.",
        "In case the source of the reparandum information gave a false alarm, the alternative of not skipping the reparandum is still available.",
        "For each utterance in the input, the parser needs to find an interpretation that starts at the first word of the input and ends at the last word.'",
        "This interpretation may have been produced by one or more applications of the repair metarule allowing the interpretation to exclude one or more reparanda.",

        "In some cases, what the user started to say is a complete constituent: take 2 The parser's lexicon has a list of 35 editing terms that activate the editing term metarule.",
        "3 For instance, a traditional way to accommodate editing terms might be via a metarule, X -> Y Z ==> X -> Y editing-term Z, where X varies over categories and Y and Z vary over sequences of categories.",
        "However, this would produce phrases containing editing terms as constituents, whereas in our approach editing terms are separate utterances.",
        "the oranges I mean take the bananas.",
        "Otherwise, the parser needs to look for an incomplete interpretation ending at the reparandum end.",
        "Typically, there will be many such interpretations; the parser searches for the longest interpretations and then ranks them based on their category: UTT > S > VP > PP, and so on.",
        "The incomplete interpretation may not extend all the way to the start of the utterance in which case the process of searching for incomplete interpretations is repeated.",
        "Of course the search process is restricted by the first incomplete constituent.",
        "If, for example, an incomplete PP is found then any additional incomplete constituent would have to expect a PP.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of this process on utterance 62 from TRAINS dialog d92a1.2 (Heeman and Allen, 1995).",
        "Assuming perfect speech repair identification, the repair metarule will be fired from position 0 to position 5 meaning the parser needs to find an interpretation starting at position 5 and ending at the last position in the input.",
        "This interpretation (the corrected utterance) is shown under the words in figure 1.",
        "The parser then needs to find an interpretation of what the speaker started to say.",
        "There are no complete constituents ending at position 5.",

        "The simple set of rules given here allows speakers to collaborate to form utterances and prevents an interruption such as a backchannel response from disrupting the syntax of another speaker's utterance.",
        "Speech repairs are captured by parallel phrase structure trees, and editing terms are represented as separate utterances occurring inside other utterances.",
        "Since the parser has knowledge of grammar and the syntactic structure of the input, it can boost speech repair identification performance.",
        "In the experiments of this paper, the parser was able to increase the recall of a pre-parser speech identifier by 4.8%.",
        "Another advantage of giving speech repair information to the parser is that the parser can then include reparanda in its output and a truer picture of dialog structure can be formed.",
        "This can be crucial if a pronoun antecedent is present in the reparandum as in have the engine take the oranges to Elmira, um, I mean, take them to Corning.",
        "In addition, this information can help a dialog system detect uncertainty and planning difficultly in speakers.",
        "The framework presented here is sufficient to describe the 3441 human-human utterances comprising the chosen set of TRAINS dialogs.",
        "More corpus investigation is necessary before we can claim the framework provides broad coverage of human-human dialog.",
        "Another necessary test of the framework is extension to dialogs involving more than two speakers.",
        "Long term goals include further investigation into the TRAINS corpus and attempting full dialog analysis rather than experimenting with small groups of overlapping utterances.",
        "Another long term goal is to weigh the current framework against a purely robust parsing approach (Rose and Levin, 1998), (Lavie, 1995) that treats out of vocabulary/grammar phenomena in the same way as editing terms and speech repairs.",
        "Robust parsing is critical to a parser",
        "such as the one described here which has a coverage of only 62% on fluent utterances.",
        "In our corpus, the speech repair to utterance ratio is 14%.",
        "Thus, problems due to the coverage of the grammar are more than twice as likely as speech repairs.",
        "However, speech repairs occur with enough frequency to warrant separate attention.",
        "Unlike grammar failures, repairs are generally signaled not only by ungrammaticality, but also by pauses, editing terms, parallelism, etc.",
