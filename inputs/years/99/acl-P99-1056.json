        "One central characteristic of alphabetic writing systems is the existence of a direct mapping between letters or letter groups and phonemes.",
        "In most languages, although to a varying extent, the mapping from print to sound can be characterized as quasi-systematic (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996; Chater & Christiansen, 1998).",
        "Thus, descriptively, in addition to a large body of regularities (e.g. the grapheme CH in French regularly maps onto /1/), one generally observes isolated deviations (e.g. CH in CHAOS maps onto /k/) as well as ambiguities.",
        "In some cases but not always, these difficulties can be alleviated by considering higher order regularities such as local orthographic environment (e.g., C maps onto /k/ or /s/ as a function of the following letter), phonotactic and phonological constraints as well as morphological properties (Cf. PH in PHASE vs. SHEPHERD).",
        "One additional difficulty stems from the fact that the graphemes, the orthographic counterparts of phonemes, can consist either of single letters or of letter groups, as the previous examples illustrate.",
        "Psycholinguistic theories of visual word recognition have taken the quasi-systematicity of writing into account in two opposite ways.",
        "In one framework, generally known as dual-route theories (e.g. Coltheart, 1978; Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, & Haller, 1993), it is assumed that dominant mapping regularities are abstracted to derive a tabulation of grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules, which may then be looked up to derive a pronunciation for any letter string.",
        "Because the rule table only captures the dominant regularities, it needs to be complemented by lexical knowledge to handle deviations and ambiguities (i.e., CHAOS, SHEPHERD).",
        "The opposite view, based on the parallel distributed processing framework, assumes that the whole set of grapho-phonological regularities is captured through differentially weighted associations between letter coding and phoneme coding units of varying sizes (Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989; Plaut, Seidenberg, McClelland & Patterson, 1996).",
        "These opposing theories have nourished an ongoing complex empirical debate for a number of years.",
        "This controversy constitutes one instance of a more general issue in cognitive science, which bears upon the proper explanation of rule-like behavior.",
        "Is the language user's capacity to exploit print-sound regularities, for instance to generate a plausible pronunciation for a new, unfamiliar string of letters, best explained by knowledge of abstract all-or-none rules, or of the",
        "statistical structure of the language?",
        "We believe that, in the field of visual word processing, the lack of precise quantitative descriptions of the mapping system is one factor that has impeded resolution of these issues.",
        "In this paper, we present a descriptive analysis of the grapheme-phoneme mapping system of the French orthography, and we further explore the sensitivity of adult human readers to some characteristics of this mapping.",
        "The results indicate that human naming performance is influenced by the frequency of graphemic units in the language and by the predictability of their mapping to phonemes.",
        "We argue that these results implicate the availability of graded knowledge of grapheme-phoneme mappings and hence, that they are more consistent with a parallel distributed approach than with the abstract rules hypothesis."

        "In both manipulations, the stimuli in the contrasted lists were selected pairwise to be as equivalent as possible in terms of potentially important variables.",
        "A difference between high and low-entropy pseudowords was also observed in the delayed naming condition.",
        "The latter effect is probably due to phonetic characteristics of the initial consonants in the stimuli.",
        "Some evidence confirming this interpretation is adduced from a further control experiment in which participants were required to repeat the same stimuli presented auditorily, after a variable response delay.",
        "The 27 msec difference in the visual delayed naming condition was tightly reproduced with auditory stimuli, indicating that the effect in the delayed naming condition is unrelated to print-to-sound conversion processes.",
        "Despite this unexpected bias, however, when the influence of phonetic factors was eliminated by computing the difference between immediate and delayed naming, a significant effect of 21 msec remained, demonstrating that entropy affects grapheme-phoneme conversion.",
        "These findings are incompatible with current implementations of the dual-route theory (Coltheart et al., 1993).",
        "The \"central dogma\" of this theory is that the performance of human subjects on pseudowords is accounted for by an analytic process based on grapheme-phoneme conversion rules.",
        "Both findings are at odds with the additional core assumptions that (1) only",
        "dominant mappings are retained as conversion rules; (2) there is no place for ambiguity or predictability in the conversion.",
        "In a recent paper, Rastle and Coltheart (1999) note that \"One refinement of dual-route modeling that goes beyond DRC in its current form is the idea that different GPC rules might have different strengths, with the strength of the correspondence being a function'of, for example, the proportion of words in which the correspondence occurs.",
        "Although simple to implement, we have not explored the notion of rule strength in the DRC model because we are not aware of any work which demonstrates that any kind of rule-strength variable has effects on naming latencies when other variables known to affect such latencies such as neighborhood size (e.g., Andrews, 1992) and string length (e.g., Weekes, 1997) are controlled.\"",
        "We believe that the present results provide the evidence that was called for and should incite dual-route modelers to abandon the idea of all-or-none rules which was a central theoretical assumption of these models compared to connectionist ones.",
        "As the DRC model is largely based on the interactive activation principles, the most natural way to account for graded effects of grapheme frequency and pronunciation predictability would be to introduce grapheme and phoneme units in the nonlexical system.",
        "Variations in the activation resting level of grapheme detectors as a function of frequency of occurrence and differences in the strength of the connections between graphemes and phonemes as a function of association probability would then explain grapheme frequency and grapheme entropy effects.",
        "However an implementation of rule-strength in the conversion system of the kind suggested considerably modifies its processing mechanism, notably by replacing the serial table lookup selection of graphemes by a parallel activation process.",
        "Such a change is highly likely to induce non-trivial consequences on predicted performance.",
        "Furthermore, and contrary to the suggestion that the introduction of rule-strength would amount to a mere implementational adaptation of no theoretical importance, we consider that it would impose a substantial restatement of the theory, because it violates the core assumption of the approach, namely, that language users induce all-or-none rules from the language to which they are exposed.",
        "Hence, the cost of such a (potential) improvement in descriptive adequacy is the loss of explanatory value from a psycholinguistic perspective.",
        "As Seidenberg stated, \"[we are] not claiming that data of the sort presented [here] cannot in principle be accommodated within a dual route type of model.",
        "In the absence of any constraints on the introduction of new pathways or recognition processes, models in the dual route framework can always be adapted to fit the empirical data.",
        "Although specific proposals might be refuted on the basis of empirical data, the general approach cannot.\"",
        "(Seidenberg, 1985, p. 244).",
        "The difficulty to account for the present findings within the dual-route approach contrasts with the straigthforward explanation they receive in the PDP framework.",
        "As has often been emphasized, rule-strength effects emerge as a natural consequence of learning and processing mechanisms in parallel distributed systems (see Van Orden, Pennington, & Stone, 1990; Plaut et al., 1996).",
        "In this framework, the rule-governed behavior is explained by the gradual encoding of the statistical structure that governs the mapping between orthography and phonology."

        "capture some important features of the processing system and thus provide an empirical validation of the approach.",
        "Most interestingly, the sensitivity of human processing to the degree of regularity and frequency of grapheme-phoneme associations provides a new argument in favor of models in which knowledge of print-to-sound mapping is based on a large set of graded associations rather than on correspondence rules."
