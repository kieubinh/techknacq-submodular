        "Mechanised formal specification and verification tools can significantly aid system design in both software and hardware (Clarke and Wing, 1996).",
        "One well-established approach to verification, particularly of hardware and protocols, is temporal model checking, which allows the designer to check that certain desired properties hold of the system (Clarke and Emerson, 1981).",
        "In this approach, specifications are expressed in a temporal logic and systems are represented as finite state transition systems.' An efficient search method determines whether the desired property is true in the model provided by the transition system; if not, it provides a counterexample.",
        "Despite the undoubted success of temporal model checking as a technique, the requirement that specifications be expressed in temporal logic has proved an obstacle to its take-up by circuit designers and therefore alternative interfaces involving graphics and natural language have been explored.",
        "In this paper, we address some of the challenges raised by converting",
        "English specifications into temporal logic as a prelude to hardware verification.",
        "One general approach to this kind of task exploits existing results in the computational analysis of natural language semantics, including contextual phenomena such as anaphora and ellipsis, in order to bridge the gap between informal specifications in English and formal specifications in some target formalism (Fuchs and Schwitter, 1996; Schwitter and Fuchs, 1996; Pulman, 1996; Nelken and Francez, 1996).",
        "English input sentences are initially mapped into a general purpose semantic formalism such as Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) or the Core Language Engine's quasi logical form (Alshawi, 1992) at which point context dependencies are resolved.",
        "The output of this stage then undergoes a further mapping into the application-specific language which expresses formal specifications.",
        "One system which departs from this framework is presented by Fantechi et al.",
        "(1994), whose grammar contains special purpose rules for recognising constructions that map directly into ACTL formulas,2 and can trigger clarification dialogues with the user in the case of a one-to-many mapping.",
        "Independently, the interface may require the user to employ a controlled language, in which syntax and lexicon are restricted in order to minimise ambiguity with respect to the formal specification language (Macias and Pulman, 1995; Fuchs and Schwitter, 1996; Schwitter and Fuchs, 1996).",
        "The design of a controlled language is one method of addressing the key problem pointed out by Pulman (1996, p. 235), namely to ensure that an English input has a valid translation into the target formalism; this is the problem that we focus on here.",
        "Inevitably, we need to pay some attention to",
        "the syntactic and semantic properties of our target formalism and this is the topic of the next section."

        "As pointed out by Thomason (1984), branching time provides a basis for formalising the intuition that statements of necessity and possibility are often non-trivially tensed.",
        "As we move forward through time, certain possible worlds (i.e., paths in the tree) are eliminated, and thus what was possible at t is no longer available as an option at some t' later than t. CTL uses formulas beginning with A to express necessity.",
