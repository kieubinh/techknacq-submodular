        "The semantic analysis of Japanese noun phrases of the form N1 no N2 is one of the difficult problems which cannot be solved by the current efforts of many researchers.",
        "Roughly speaking, Japanese noun phrase N1 no N2 corresponds to English noun phrase N2 of N1.",
        "However, the Japanese postposition no has much broader usage than of as follows: watashi T no kuruma 'car' possession tsukue 'desk' no ashi 'leg' whole-part gray no seihuku 'uniform' modification senmonka 'expert' no chousa 'study'",
        "The conventional approach to this problem was to classify semantic relations, such as possession, whole-part, modification, and others.",
        "Then, classification rules were crafted by hand, or detected from relation-tagged examples by a machine learning technique (Shimazu et al., 1987; Sumita et al., 1990; Tomiura et al., 1995; Kurohashi et al., 1998).",
        "The problem in such an approach is to set up the semantic relations.",
        "For example, the above examples and their classification came from the IPA nominal dictionary (Information-Technology Promotion Agency, Japan, 1996).",
        "Is it possible to find clear boundaries among subject, category, result, purpose, instrument, and others?",
        "No matter how fine-grained relations we set up, we always encounter phrases which are on the boundary or belong to two or more relations.",
        "This paper proposes a completely different approach to the task, which exploits semantic role information of nouns in an ordinary dictionary."

        "For example, the case grammar theory is a semantic valence theory that describes the logical form of a sentence in terms of a predicate and a series of case-labeled arguments such as agent, object, location, source, goal (Fillmore, 1968).",
        "Furthermore, a wide-coverage dictionary describing semantic roles of verbs in machine readable form has been constructed by a great deal of labor (Ikehara et al., 1997).",
        "Not only verbs, but also nouns can have semantic roles.",

        "That is, the interpretation of the phrase can be regarded as matching rugby in the phrase to some sport in the coach definition.",

        "The relation between N1 and N2 does not come from N1 's semantic roles, or it is not so weak as the other relations.",
