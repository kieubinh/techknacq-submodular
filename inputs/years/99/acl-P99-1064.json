        "(la) At what time did you reach the top?",
        "At noon sharp.",
        "(lb) At what moment did you spot the plane?",
        "At 10:53 A.M. (2a) *John finished leaving.",
        "(2b) John finished drawing the circle.",
        "Dowty (1986) and Moens and Steedman (1988) decisively questioned the coherence of the class of achievement verbs, arguing that not all of them are non-durative.",
        "As noted above, Vendler identifies punctual events through the conjunction of the (positive) at and (negative) finish tests.",
        "However, they do not always yield comparable results :",
        "(3a) Karpov beat Kasparov at 10.00 P.M. (3b) *The Allies beat Germany at 10.00 P.M. (4a) *Karpov finished beating Kasparov (4b) The Allies finished beating Germany.",
        "The at test fails to characterize (3b) as an achievement because it is durative, whereas (3a) passes this very test because it is non-durative.",
        "On the contrary, the finish test in (4) yields an identical result for the beating of a chess player and that of a whole nation.",
        "It appears thus that the finish test does not indicate non-durativity, contrary to the at test, which refuses durative events, and that telic events such as (3b) fall outside Vendler's classification, since they fail both the finish test (unlike accomplishments) AND the at test (unlike achievements).",
        "Since it",
        "is desirable that achievements should include events such as (3b), durativity should not be considered as a necessary property of achievements.",
