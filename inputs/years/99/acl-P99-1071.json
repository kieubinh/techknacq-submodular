        "Information overload has created an acute need for summarization.",

        "Hundreds of news stories on the same event are produced daily by news agencies.",
        "Repeated information about the event is a good indicator of its impor-tancy to the event, and can be used for summary generation.",
        "Most research on single document summarization, particularly for domain independent tasks, uses sentence extraction to produce a summary (Lin and Hovy, 1997; Marcu, 1997; Salton et al., 1991).",
        "In the case of multi-document summarization of articles about the same event, the original articles can include both similar and contradictory information.",
        "Extracting all similar sentences would produce a verbose and repetitive summary, while extra.cting some similar sentences could produce a summary biased towards some sources.",
        "Instead, we move beyond sentence extraction, using a comparison of extracted similar sentences to select the phrases that should be included in the summary and sentence generation to reformulate them as new text.",
        "Our work is part of a full summarization system (McKeown et al., 1999), which extracts sets of similar sentences, themes (Eskin et al., 1999), in the first stage for input to the components described here.",

        "• Content planning operates over full",
        "sentences, producing sentence fragments.",

        "We modified the input specification language for FUF/SURGE to account for these problems We added features that indicate the ordering of circumstantials in the output.",
        "Ordering of circumstantials can easily be derived from their ordering in the input.",
        "Thus, we label circumstantials with the features front-i (i-th circumstantial at the front of the sentence) and end-i (i-th circumstantial at the end), where i indicates the relative ordering of the circumstantial within the clause.",
        "In addition, if possible, when mapping input phrases to a SURGE syntactic input, the sentence planner tries to determine the semantic type of circumstantial by looking up the preposition (for example: \"after\" indicates a \"time\" circumstantial).",
        "This allows FUF/SURGE to map the syntactic category of the circumstantial to the semantic and syntactic features expected by SURGE.",
        "However, in cases where the preposition is ambiguous (e.g., \"in\" can indicate \"time\" or \"location\") the generator must rely solely on ordering circumstantials based on ordering found in the input.",
        "We have modified SURGE to accept this type of input: in all places SURGE checks the semantic type of the circumstantial before making choices, we verified that the absence of the corresponding input feature would not lead to an inappropriate default being selected.",
        "In summary, this new application for syntactic realization highlights the need for supporting hybrid inputs of variable abstraction levels.",
        "The implementation benefited from the bidirectional nature of FUF unification in the handling of hybrid constraints and required little change to the existing SURGE grammar.",

        "From the generation side, our main goal is to make the generated summary more concise, primarily by combining clauses together.",
        "We will be investigating what factors influence the combination process and how they can be computed from input articles.",
        "Part of combination will involve increasing coherence of the generated text through the use of connectives, anaphora or lexical relations (Jing, 1999).",
        "One interesting problem for future work is the question of how much context to include from a sentence from which an intersected phrase is drawn.",
        "Currently, we include no context, but in some cases context is crucial even though it is not a part of the intersection.",
        "This is the case, for example, when the context negates, or denies, the embedded sub-clause which matches a sub-clause in another negating context.",
        "In such cases, the resulting summary is actually false.",
        "This occurs just once in our test cases, but it is a serious error.",
        "Our work will characterize the types of contextual information that should be retained and will develop algorithms for the case of negation, among others."
