        "Writing improves with revision.",
        "Authors are familiar with the process of condensing a long paper into a shorter one: this is an iterative process, with the results improved over successive drafts.",
        "Professional abstractors carry out substantial revision and editing of abstracts (Cremmins 1996).",
        "We therefore expect revision to be useful in automatic text summarization.",
        "Prior research exploring the use of revision in summarization, e.g., (Gabriel 1988), (Robin 1994), (McKeown et al.",
        "1995) has focused mainly on structured data as the input.",
        "Here, we examine the use of revision in summarization of text input.",
        "First, we review some summarization terminology.",
        "In revising draft summaries, these condensation operations, as well as stylistic rewording of sentences, play an important role.",
        "Summaries can be used to indicate what topics are addressed in the source text, and thus can be used to alert the user as to the source content (the indicative function).",
        "Summaries can also be used to cover the concepts in the source text to the extent possible given the compression requirements for the summary (the informotive function).",
        "Summaries can be tailored to a reader's interests and expertise, yielding topic-related summaries, or they can be aimed at a particular - usually broad - readership community, as in the case of (so-called) generic summaries.",
        "Revision here applies to generic and topic-related informative summaries, intended for publishing and dissemination.",
        "Summarization can be viewed as a text-to-text reduction operation involving three main condensation operations: selection of salient portions of the text, aggregation of information from different portions of the text, and abstraction of specific information with more general information (Mani and Maybury 1999).",
        "Our approach to revision is to construct an initial draft summary of a source text and then to add to the draft additional background information.",
        "Rather than concatenate material in the draft (as surface-oriented, sentence extraction summarizers do), information in the draft is combined and excised based on revision rules involving aggregation (Dalianis and Hovy 1996) and elimination operations.",
        "Elimination can increase the amount of compression (summary length/source length) available, while aggregation can potentially gather and draw in relevant background information, in the form of descriptions of discourse entities from different parts of the source.",
        "We therefore hypothesize that these operations can result in packing in more information per unit compression than possible by concatenation.",
        "Rather than opportunistically adding as much background information that can fit in the available compression, as in (Robin 1994), our approach adds background information from the source text to the draft based on an information weighting function.",
        "Our revision approach assumes input sentences are represented as syntactic trees whose",
        "nodes are annotated with coreference information.",
        "In order to provide open-domain coverage the approach does not assume a meaning-level representation of each sentence, and so, unlike many generation systems, the system does not represent and reason about what is being said'.",
        "Meaning-dependent revision operations are restricted to situations where it is clear from coreference that the same entity is being talked about.",
        "There are several criteria our revision model needs to satisfy.",
        "The final draft needs to be informative, coherent, and grammatically well-formed.",
        "Informativeness is explored in Section 4.2.",
        "We can also strive to guarantee, based on our revision rule set, that each revision will be syntactically well-formed.",
        "Regarding coherence, revision alters rhetorical structure in a way which can produce disfluencies.",
        "As rhetorical structure is hard to extract from the source2, our program instead uses coreference to guide the revision, and attempts to patch the coherence by adjusting references in revised drafts."

      "text": [
        "The summary revision program takes as input a source document, a draft summary specification, and a target compression rate.",
        "Using revision rules, it generates a revised summary draft whose compression rate is no more than S above the target compression rate.",
        "The initial draft summary (and background) are specified in terms of a task-dependent weighting function which indicates the relative importance of each of the source document sentences.",
        "The program repeatedly selects the highest weighted sentence from the source and adds it to the initial draft until the given compression percentage of the source has been extracted, rounded to the nearest sentence.",
        "Next, for each rule in the sequence of revision rules, the program repeatedly applies the rule until it can no longer be applied.",
        "Each rule application results in a revised draft.",
        "The program selects sentences for rule application by giving preference to higher weighted sentences.",
        "'Note that professional abstractors do not attempt to fully \"understand\" the text - often extremely technical material, but use surface-level features as above as well as the overall discourse structure of the text (Cremmins 1996).",
        "A unary rule applies to a single sentence.",
        "A binary rule applies to a pair of sentences, at least one of which must be in the draft, and where the first sentence precedes the second in the input.",
        "Control over sentence complexity is imposed by failing rule application when the draft sentence is too long, the parse tree is too deep3, or if more than two relative clauses would be stacked together.",
        "The program terminates when there are no more rules to apply or when the revised draft exceeds the required compression rate by more than 5.",
        "The syntactic structure of each source sentence is extracted using Apple Pie 7.2 (Sekine 1998), a statistical parser trained on Penn Treebank data.",
        "It was evaluated by (Sekine 1998) as having 79% F-score accuracy (parseval) on short sentences (less than 40 words) from the Treebank.",
        "An informal assessment we made of the accuracy of the parser (based on intuitive judgments) on our own data sets of news articles suggests about 66% of the parses were acceptable, with almost half of the remaining parsing errors being due to part-of-speech tagging errors, many of which could be fixed by preprocessing the text.",
        "To establish coreference between proper names, named entities are extracted from the document, along with coreference relations using SRA's NameTag 2.0 (Krupka 1995), a MUC-6 fielded system.",
        "In addition, we implemented our own coreference extension: A singular definite NP (e.g., beginning with \"the\", and not marked as a proper name) is marked by our program as coreferential (i.e., in the same coreference equivalence class) with the last singular definite or singular indefinite atomic NP with the same head, provided they are within a distance y of each other.",
        "On a corpus of 90 documents, drawn from the TIPSTER evaluation, described in Section 4.1 below, this coreference extension scored 94% precision (470 valid coreference classes/501 total coreference classes) on definite NP coreference.",
        "Also, \"he\" (likewise \"she\") is marked, subject to 7, as coreferential with the last person name mentioned, with gender agreement enforced when the person's first name's gender is known (from NameTag's list of common first names)4.",
        "Most",
        "of the errors were caused by different sequences of words between the determiner and the noun phrase head word (e.g., \"the factory\" = \"the cramped five-story pre-1915 factory\" is OK, but \"the virus program\"= \"the graduate computer science program\" isn't)."

        "The basis for combining sentences is that of referential identity: if there is an NP in sentence i which is coreferential with an NP in sentence j, then sentences i and j are candidates for aggregation.",

        "subject is coreferential with an NP of an earlier (draft) sentence into a relative clause modifier of the draft sentence NP.",
        "Other appositive phrase insertion rules include copying and inserting nonrestrictive relative clause modifiers (e.g., \"Smith, who...,\"), appositive modifiers of proper names (e.g., \"Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert familiar with the case,...\"), and proper name appositive modifiers of definite NPs (e.g., \"The network, named ARPANET, is operated by ..\" ).",
        "Smoothing operations apply to a single sentence, performing transformations so as to arrive at more compact, stylistically preferred sentences.",
        "There are two types of smoothing.",

        "It usually applies to the result of an aggregation rule which conjoins clauses whose subjects are coreferential.",
        "Relative clause reduction includes rules which apply to clauses whose VPs begin with \"be\" (e.g., \"which is\" is deleted) or \"have\" (e.g., \"which have\" \"with\"), as well as for other verbs, a rule deleting the relative pronoun and replacing the verb with its present participle (i.e., \"which V\" \"V-Fing\").",
        "Coordination rules include relative clause coordination.",
        "Reference Adjustment operations fix up the results of other revision operations in order to improve discourse-level coherence, and as a result, they are run lase.",
        "They include substitution of a proper name with a name alias if the name is mentioned earlier, expansion of a pronoun with a coreferential proper name in a parenthetical (\"pronoun expansion\"), and (\"indefinitization\") replacement of a definite NP with a coreferential indefinite if the definite occurs without a prior indefinite."
