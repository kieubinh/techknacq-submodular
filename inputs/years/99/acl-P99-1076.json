        "The inherent characteristics of LTAGs (i.e. lexicalization, adjunction, an extended domain of locality and \"mildly-context sensitive\" power) makes it attractive to Natural Language Processing : LTAGs are parsable in polynomial time and allow an elegant and psycholinguistically plausible representation of natural language'.",

        "Trees that are not auxiliary are initial.",
        "Elementary trees combine with 2 operations : substitution and adjunction.",
        "Substitution is compulsory and is used essentially for arguments (subject, verb and noun complements).",
        "It consists in replacing in a tree (elementary or not) a node marked for substitution with an initial tree that has a root of same category.",
        "Adjunction is optional (although it can be forbidden or made compulsory using specific constraints) and deals essentially with detertniners, modifiers, auxiliaries, modals, raising verbs (e.g. seem).",
        "It consists in inserting in a tree in place of a node X an auxiliary tree with a root of same category.",
        "The descendants of X then become the descendants of the foot node of the auxiliary tree.",
        "Contrary to context-free rewriting rules, the history of derivation must be made explicit since the same derived tree can be obtained using different derivations.",
        "This is why parsing LTAGs yields a derivation tree, from",
        "which a derived tree (i.e. constituent tree) can be obtained.",
        "(Figure 1)3 .",
        "Branches in a derivation tree are unordered.",

        "MA accounts for the preferred reading of (b) \"for Sue\" attaches to \"bought\" and not to \"flowers\" (Frazier & Fodor (78))",
        "These structural principles have been criticized though : Among other things, the interaction between these principles is unclear.",
        "This type of approach lacks provision for integration with semantics and/or pragmatics (Schubert (84)), does not clearly establish the distinction between arguments and modifiers (Ferreira & Clifton (86)) and is English-biased : evidence against RA has been found for Spanish (Cuetos & Mitchell (88)) and Dutch (Brysbaert & Mitchell (96)).",
        "Some parsing preferences are widely accepted, though : The idiomatic interpretation of a sentence is favored over its literal interpretation (Gibbs & Nayak (89)).",
        "Arguments are preferred over modifiers (Abney (89), Britt & al.",
        "(92)).",
        "Additionally, lexical factors (e.g. frequency of subcategorization for a given verb) have been shown to influence parsing preferences (Hindle & Rooth (93)).",
        "It is striking that these three most consensual types of syntactic preferences turn out to be difficult to formalize by resorting only to \"constituent trees\" , but easy to formalize in terms of LTAGs.",
        "Before explaining our approach, we must underline that the examples4 presented later on are not necessarily counterexamples to RA and or MA, but just illustrations : our goal is not to further criticize RA and MA, but to show that problems linked to these \"traditional\" structural approaches do not automatically condemn all structural approaches."
