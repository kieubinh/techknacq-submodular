        "The notion of text cohesion rests on the intuition that a text is \"held together\" by a variety of internal forces.",
        "Much of the relevant linguistic literature is indebted to Halliday and Hasan (1976), where cohesion is defined as a network of relationships between locations in the text, arising from (i) grammatical factors (co-reference, use of pro-forms, ellipsis and sentential connectives), and (ii) lexical factors (reiteration and collocation).",
        "Subsequent work has further developed this taxonomy (Hoey, 1991) and explored its implications in such areas as paragraphing (Longacre, 1979; Bond and Hayes, 1984; Stark, 1988), relevance (Sperber and Wilson, 1995) and discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "The lexical variety of cohesion is semantically defined, invoking a measure of word similarity.",
        "But this is hard to measure objectively, especially in the case of collocational relationships, which hold between words primarily because they \"regularly co-occur.\"",
        "Halliday and Hasan refrained from a deeper analysis, but hinted at a notion of \"degrees of proximity in the lexical system, a function of the probability with which one tends to co-occur with an-other.\"",
        "(p. 290) The VecTile system presented here is designed to utilize precisely this kind of lexical relationship, relying on observations on a large training corpus to derive a measure of similarity between words and text passages."

        "Previous approaches to calculating cohesion differ in the kind of lexical relationship they quantify and in the amount of semantic knowledge they rely on.",
        "Topic parsing (Hahn, 1990) utilizes both grammatical cues and semantic inference based on precoded domain-specific knowledge.",
        "More general approaches assess word similarity based on thesauri (Morris and Hirst, 1991) or dictionary definitions (Kozima, 1994).",
        "Methods that solely use observations of patterns in vocabulary use include vocabulary management (Youmans, 1991) and the blocks algorithm plemented in the TextTiling system (Hearst, 1997).",
        "The latter is compared below with the system introduced here.",

        "Such a representation can be obtained automatically and often provides sufficient information to make deep linguistic analysis unnecessary.",
        "This has led to promising results in information retrieval and related areas (Flournoy et al., 1998a; Flournoy et al., 1998b).",
        "Given a dictionary W and a relatively small set C of meaningful \"content\" words, for each pair in W x C, the number of times is recorded that the two co-occur within some measure of distance in a training corpus.",
        "This yields a ICI-dimensional vector for each w E W. The direction that the vector has in the resulting 1C1-dimensional space then represents the collocational behavior of w in the training corpus.",
        "In the present implementation, 1W1 = 20,500 and ICI = 1000.",
        "For computational efficiency and to avoid the high number of zero values in the resulting matrix, the matrix is reduced to 100 dimensions using Singular-Value Decomposition (Golub and van Loan, 1989).",

        "The similarity curve over the text, obtained as described above, is smoothed out by a simple low-pass filter, and low points are assigned depth scores according to the difference between their values and those of the surrounding peaks.",
        "The mean and standard deviation of those depth scores are used to calculate a cutoff below which a trough is judged to be near a section break.",

        "Paragraph numbers are inside the plot at the bottom.",
        "Speaker judgments by five subjects are inserted in five rows in the upper half.",
        "The crucial difference between this and the TextTiling system is that the latter builds window vectors solely by counting the occurrences of strings in the windows.",
        "Repetition is rewarded by the present approach, too, as identical .",
        "words contribute most to the similarity between the block vectors.",
        "However, similarity scores can be high even in the absence of pure string repetition, as long as the adjacent windows contain words that co-occur frequently in the training corpus.",
        "Thus what a direct comparison between the systems will show is whether the addition of collocational information gleaned from the training corpus sharpens or blunts the judgment.",
        "For comparison, the TextTiling algorithm was implemented and run with the same window size (200) and gap interval (10)."

        "To obtain an \"expert opinion\" against which to compare the algorithms, those paragraph boundaries were marked as \"correct\" section breaks which at least three out of the five subjects had marked.",
        "(Three out of seven (Litman and Passonneau, 1995; Hearst, 1997) or 30% (Kozima, 1994) are also sometimes deemed sufficient.)",
        "For the two systems as well as the subjects, precision and recall with respect to the set of \"correct\" section breaks were calculated.",
        "The results are listed in Table 1.",
        "The context vectors clearly led to an improved performance over the counting of pure string repetitions.",
        "The simple assignment of section breaks to the nearest paragraph boundary may have led to noise in some cases; moreover, it is not really part of the task of measuring cohesion.",
        "Therefore the texts were processed again, this time moving the windows over whole paragraphs at a time, calculating gap-values at the paragraph gaps.",
        "For each paragraph break, the number of subjects who had marked it as a section break was taken as an indicator of the \"strength\" of the boundary.",
        "There was a significant negative correlation between the values calculated by both systems and that measure of strength, with r = â€“ .338(p = .0002) for the VecTile system and r = â€“ .220(p = .0172) for TextTiling.",
        "In othei words, deep gaps in the similarity measure are associated with strong agreement between subjects that the spot marks a section boundary.",
        "Although r2 is low both cases, the VecTile system yields more significant results.",
        "5.3 Discussion and Further Work The results discussed above need further support with a larger subject pool, as the level of agre6-: ment among the judges was at the low end of what can be considered significant.",
        "This is shown by the Kappa coefficients, measured against the expert opinion and listed in Table 2.",
        "The overall average was .594.",
        "Despite this caveat, the results clearly show that adding collocational information from the training",
        "corpus improves the prediction of section breaks, hence, under common assumptions, the measurement of lexical cohesion.",
        "It is likely that these encouraging results can be further improved.",
        "Following are a few suggestions of ways to do so.",
        "Some factors work against the context vector method.",
        "For instance, the system currently has no mechanism to handle words that it has no context vectors for.",
        "Often it is precisely the co-occurrence of uncommon words not in the training corpus (personal names, rare terminology etc.)",
        "that ties text together.",
        "Such cases pose no challenge to the string-based system, but the VecTile system cannot utilize them.",
        "The best solution might be a hybrid system with a backup procedure for unknown words.",
        "Another point to note is how well the much simpler TextTile system compares.",
        "Indeed, a close look at the figures in Table 1 reveals that the better results of the VecTile system are due in large part to one of the texts, viz. #2.",
        "Considering the additional effort and resources involved in using context vectors, the modest boost in performance might often not be worth the effort in practice.",
        "This suggests that pure string repetition is a particularly strong indicator of similarity, and the vector-based system might benefit from a mechanism to give those vectors a higher weight than co-occurrences of merely similar words.",
        "Another potentially important parameter is the nature of the training corpus.",
        "In this case, it consisted mainly of news texts, while the texts in the experiment were scientific expository texts.",
        "A more homogeneous setting might have further improved the results.",
        "Finally, the evaluation of results in this task is complicated by the fact that \"near-hits\" (cases in which a section break is off by one paragraph) do not have any positive effect on the score: This problem has been dealt with in the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) project by a more flexible score that becomes gradually worse as the distance between hypothesized and \"real\" boundaries increases (TDT, 1997a; TDT, 1997b)."
