        "The idea of producing abstracts or summaries by automatic means is not new, several methodologies have been proposed and tested for automatic abstracting including among others: word distribution (Luhn, 1958); rhetorical analysis (Marcu, 1997); and probabilistic models (Kupiec et al., 1995).",
        "Even though some approaches produce acceptable abstracts for specific tasks, it is generally agreed that the problem of coherent selection and expression of information in automatic abstracting remains (Johnson, 1995).",
        "One of the main problems is how to ensure the preservation of the message of the original text if sentences picked up from distant parts of the source text are juxtaposed and presented to the reader.",
        "Rino and Scott (1996) address the problem of coherent selection for gist preservation, however they depend on the availability of a complex meaning representation which in practice is difficult to obtain from the raw text.",
        "In our work, we are concerned with the automatic generation of short indicative-informative abstract for technical and scientific papers.",
        "We base our methodology on a study of a corpus of professional abstracts and source or parent documents.",

        "The production of professional abstracts has long been object of study (Cremmins, 1982).",
        "In particular, it has been argued that structural parts of parent documents such as introductions and conclusions are important in order to obtain the information for the topical sentence (Endres-Niggemeyer et al., 1995).",
        "We have been investigating which kind of information is reported in professional abstracts as well as where the information lies in parent documents and how it is conveyed.",
        "In Figure 1, we show a professional abstract from the \"Computer and Control Abstracts\" journal, this kind of abstract aims to alert readers about the existence of a new article in a particular field.",
        "The example contains information about the author's interest, the author's development and the overview of the parent document.",
        "All the information reported in this abstract was found in the introduction of its parent document.",
        "In order to study the aforementioned aspects, we have manually aligned sentences of 100 professional abstracts with sentences of parent documents containing the information reported in the abstract.",
        "In a previous study (Saggion and Lapalme, 1998), we have shown that 72% of the information in professional abstracts lies in titles, captions, first sections and last sections of parent documents while the rest of the information was found in author abstracts and other sections.",
        "These results suggest that some structural sections are particularly important in order to select information for an abstract but also",
        "The production of understandable and maintainable expert systems using the current generation of multiparadigm development tools is addressed.",
        "This issue is discussed in the context of COMPASS, a large and complex expert system that helps maintain an electronic telephone exchange.",
        "As part of the work on COMPASS, several techniques to aid maintainability were developed and successfully implemented.",
        "Some of the techniques were new, others were derived from traditional software engineering but modified to fit the rapid prototyping approach of expert system building.",

        "The complex process of scientific discovery that starts with the identification of a research problem and eventually ends with an answer to the problem (Bunge, 1967), would generally be disseminated in a technical or scientific paper: a complex record of knowledge containing, among others, references to the following concepts the author, the author's affiliation, others authors, the authors' development, the authors' interest, the research article and its components (sections, figures, tables, etc.",
        "), the problem under consideration, the authors' solution, others' solution, the topics of the research article, the motivation for the study, the importance of the study, what the author found, what the author think, what others have done, and so forth.",

        "Although our conceptual model does not deal with all the intricacies of the domain, we believe it covers most of the important information relevant for an abstract.",
        "In order to obtain linguistic expressions marking concepts and relation, we have tagged our corpus with a POS tagger (Foster, 1991) and we have used a thesaurus (Vianna, 1980) to semantically classify the lexical items (most of them are polysemous).",
