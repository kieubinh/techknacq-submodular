        "The coordinate phrase (CP) is a source of structural ambiguity in natural language.",
        "For example, take the phrase: box of chocolates and roses 'Roses' attaches either high to 'box' or low to 'chocolates'.",
        "In this case, attachment is high, yielding: H-attach: ((box (of chocolates)) (and roses)) Consider, then, the phrase: salad of lettuce and tomatoes 'Lettuce' attaches low to 'tomatoes', giving: L-attach: (salad (of ((lettuce) and (tomatoes))) Previous work has used corpus-based approaches to solve the similar problem of prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "These have included backed-off [CB 95], maximum entropy [RRR94], rule-based [HR941, and unsupervised [AR98] models.",
        "In addition to these, a corpus-based model for PP-attachment [SN971 has been reported that uses information from a semantic dictionary.",
        "Sparse data can be a major concern in corpus-based disambiguation.",
        "Supervised models are limited by the amount of annotated data available for training.",
        "Such a model is useful only for languages in which annotated corpora are available.",
        "Because an unsupervised model does not rely on such corpora it may be modified for use in multiple languages as in [AR98].",
        "The unsupervised model presented here trains from an unannotated version of the 1988 Wall Street Journal.",
        "After tagging and chunking the text, a rough heuristic is then employed to pick out training examples.",
        "This results in a training set that is less accurate, but much larger, than currently existing annotated corpora.",
        "It is the goal, then, of unsupervised training data to be abundant in order to offset its noisiness."
