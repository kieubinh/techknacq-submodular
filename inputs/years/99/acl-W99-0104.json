        "Coreference evaluation was introduced as a new domain-independent task at the 6th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) in 1995.",
        "The task focused on a subset of coreference, namely the identity coreference, established between nouns, pronouns and noun phrases (including proper names) that refer to the same entity.",
        "In defining the coreference task (cf. (Hirschman and Chinc.hor, 1997)) special care was taken to use the coreference output not only for supporting Information Extraction(IE), the central task of the MUCs, but also to create means for research on coreference and discourse phenomena independent of IE.",
        "Annotated corpora were made available, using SGML tagging within the text stream.",
        "The annotated texts served as training examples for a variety of coreference resolution methods, that had to focus not only on precision and recall, but also on robustness.",
        "Two general classes of approaches were distinguished.",
        "The first class is characterized by adaptations of previously known reference algorithms (e.g. (Lappin and Leass, 1994), (Brennan et al., 1987)) to the scarce syntactic and semantic knowledge available in an IE system (e.g. (Kameyama, 1997)).",
        "The second class is based on statistical and machine learning techniques that rely on the tagged corpora to extract features of the coreferential relations (e.g. (Aone and Bennett, 1994) (Kehler, 1997)).",
        "In the past two MUC competitions, the high scoring systems achieved a recall in the high 50's to low 60's and a precision in the low 70's (cf. (Hirschman et al., 1998)).",
        "A study' of the contribution of each form of coreference to the overall performance shows that generally, proper name anaphora resolution have the highest precision (69%), followed by pronominal reference (62%).",
        "The worse precision is obtained by the resolution of definite nominals anaphors (46%).",
        "However, these results need to be contrasted with the distribution of coreferential links on the tagged corpora.",
        "The majority of coreference links (38.42%) connect names of people, organizations or locations.",
        "In addition, 19.68% of the tagged coreference links are accounted by appositives.",
        "Only 16.35% of the tagged coreferences are pronominal.",
        "Nominal anaphors account for 25.55% of the coreference links, and their resolution is generally poorly represented in IE systems.",
        "Due to the distribution of coreference links in newswire texts, a coreference module that is merely capable of handling recognition of appositives with high precision and incorporates rules of name alias identification can achieve a baseline coreference precision up to 58.1%, without sophisticated syntactic or discourse information.",
        "Precision increase is obtained by extending high-performance pronoun resolution methods (e.g. (Lappin and Leass, 1994)) to nominal coreference as well.",
        "Such enhancements rely on semantic and discourse knowledge.",
        "In this paper we describe COCKTAIL, a high-performance coreference resolution system that operates on a mixture of heuristics that combine semantic and discourse information.",
        "The resulting",
        "coreference chains are shown to contribute in the derivation of cohesive chains and coherence graphs.",
        "Both cohesive and coherence structures are considered, partly because of their incremental complexity and partly because the tradition (started with (Hobbs, 1979)) of studying the interaction of coreference and coherence.",

        "Coreference resolution relies on a combination of linguistic and cognitive aspects of language.",
        "Linguistic constraints are provided mostly by the syntactic modeling of language, whereas computational models of discourse bring forward the cognitive assumptions of anaphora resolution.",
        "Three different methods of combining anaphoric constraints are known to date.",
        "The first one integrates anaphora resolution in computational models of discourse interpretation.",
        "Dynamic properties of discourse, especially focusing and centering are invoked as the primary basis for identifying antecedents.",
        "Such computational methods were presented in (Grosz et al., 1995) and (Webber, 1988).",
        "A second category of approaches combines a variety of syntactic, semantic and discourse factors as a multidimensional metric for ranking antecedent candidates.",
        "Anaphora resolution is determined by a composite of several distinct scoring procedures, each of which scores the prominence of the candidate with respect to a specific type of information.",
        "The systems described in (Asher and Wads, 1988) (Car-bonell and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and Luperfoy, 1988) are examples of the mixed evaluation strategy.",
        "Alternatively, other discourse-based methods consider coreference resolution a by-product of the recognition of coherence relations between sentences.",
        "Such methods were presented in (Hobbs et al., 1993) and (Wilensky, 1978).",
        "Although AI-complete, this approach has the appeal that it resolves the most complicated cases of coreference, uncovered by syntactic or semantic cues.",

        "For example, the Resolution of Anaphora Procedure (RAP) introduced in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) combines syntactic information with agreement and salience constraints.",
        "Recently, a probabilistic approach to pronominal coreference resolution was also devised (Ge et al., 1998), using the parsed data available from Treebank.",
        "The knowledge-based method of Lappin and Leass produces better results.",
        "Nevertheless, RAPSTAT, a version of RAP obtained by using statistically measured preference patterns for the antecedents, produced a slight enhancement of performance over RAP.",
        "Other pronominal resolution approaches promote knowledge-poor methods (Mitkov, 1998), either by using an ordered set of general heuristics or by combining scores assigned to candidate antecedents.",
        "The CogNIAC algorithm (Baldwin, 1997) uses six heuristic rules to resolve coreference, whereas the algorithm presented in (Mitkov, 1998) is based.",
        "on a limited set of preferences (e.g. definitiveness, lexical reiteration or immediate reference).",
        "Both these algorithm rely only on part-of-speech tagging of texts and on patterns for NP identification.",
        "Their performance (close to 90% for certain types of pronouns) indicates that full syntactic knowledge is not required by certain forms of pronominal coreference.",
        "The same claim is made in (Kennedy and Bogu-raev, 1996) and (Kameyama, 1997), where algorithms approximating RAP for poorer syntactic input obtain precision of 75% and 71%, respectively, a surprising small precision decay from RAP's 86%.",
        "These results prompted us to devise COCKTAIL, a coreference resolution system, as a mixture of heuristics performing on the various syntactic, semantic and discourse cues.",
