        "This paper explores the idea that the operations of positing and resolving bridging anaphora in NPs with deverbal heads can be successfully guided by considering as possible implicit relations those suggested by the argument structures of the corresponding verbs.",
        "Bridging is a referential phenomenon occurring when the referent of a linguistic expression can be determined only by recovering a meaningful implicit relation with an already mentioned entity or event.",
        "For example, in the following Italian sentences, the correct interpretation for richieste requires the identification of the implicit relation between the set of requests for underwriting and the bond to be underwritten.",
        "The literature describes two basic approaches to deal with bridging in CL: the first consists in working mostly at the semantic level interpreting bridging as a kind of irnplicature the reader draws to support the coherence of discourse (Asher and Las-carides, 1998, pp.1-2).",
        "The second, exemplified by (Bos, Buitelaar, and Mineur, 1995), relies primarily on augmenting the lexicon annotating for each noun its possible meaningful relations.",
        "We believe that, at least for the particular kind of bridging we are concerned with, the second approach is most promising given that, in some cases, a limited amount of lexicon annotation can greatly enhance resolution efficiency and efficacy: by using algorithms and rules relying on linguistic information we can significantly constrain inference on cognitive processing.",
        "Our contribution goes along the lines proposed in (Grosz and Sidner, 1998).",
        "We are interested in deverbal nouns (e.g. \"building\" derived from \"to build\", and \"request\" derived from \"to request\") and we endorse the claim that bridging occurring in NPs with a deverbal noun head should be resolved by considering as possible implicit relations those suggested by the argument structure of the corresponding verb, cf. inter alto Media and Sauri, 1998) and (Rozwadowska, 1988) for investigations on thematic restrictions on derived nominals.",
        "We think that the way the verb argument structure maps onto the noun argument positions depends on whether the deverbal nouns denote an event,, or a resulting state or participant in the corresponding eventuality.",
        "The idea of exploiting the event/ result reading distinction, combined with other aspectual information, was primed by the linguistic data collected during corpus analysis and proved to be quite promising.",
        "We then take it one step forward and work out which is the noun argument whose (covert or overt) presence is needed for a proper understanding of the text.",
        "This idea is captured by the notion of favourite.",
        "Our work fits in the context of automatic information extraction.",
        "In connection with the FACILE European project (LE 2440), we developed a module for texture resolutionl (TRM) to be integrated in a system of information extraction from Italian financial news.",
        "The TRM tracks entities as they 'The texture of a text is \"related to the listener's perception of coherence\" and is \"manifested by certain kinds of semantic relations (called cohesive ties] between its individual messages* (Halliday and Hasan, 1985).",
        "Examples of cohesive ties are: coreference, bridging and coclassification."

        "For instance, the di NP phrase in ex.",

        "Encoding in the lexicon the event/result reading distinction for a nominalisation is straightforward when using a conceptual dictionary like WordNet (FeBbaum, 1998): it's enough to search up in the hierarchy.",
        "For example, the noun building belongs to different synset,s (i.e. it has different senses): one has entity among its hypernyms (and thus it expresses a result) and the other two have act as hypernym (and thus they express an event).",
        "Thus this noun has both event and result.",
        "readings.",
        "The difference in the way argebients are realised in the two readings is relevant for our purpose.",
        "In the task of texture resolution, we have to find out precisely how to interpret PP modifiers', possessives and other potentially referential expressions surrounding a nominal, and when to posit a bridging anaphora and to which entity.",
        "Nominalised expressions in English and Italian do not share always the same syntactic forms.",
        "English nominals have several argument positions that can map into the basic verb arguments (subject, direct and indirect objects), cf.(Macleod et al., 1997) for a computational treatment.",

        "nominal prepositional phrase (e.g. 'The announcement of the White House\").",
        "In Italian, the grammar of nominalisation phrases is somewhat simpler.",
        "Arguments can be expressed either by a possessive3 or relative pronouns, classified as prenominal modifiers (e.g. \"il suo annuncio\" [his announcement], \"ii cui annuncio\" [whose announcement]), or PPs, here called postnominal modifiers (e.g. \"Pannuncio del • president?",
        "(the announcement of the president)), cf. (Renzi, 1991) for a description.",
        "Only PPs of the form di NP (lit.",
        "of PP in English) raise interesting questions from our point of view, since PPs other than di NP can be interpreted directly by looking at the argument structure of the related verb, broadly speaking.",
        "The major difficulty comes from roles assigned to verb argument positions which are not `identified' by specific prepositions, because these roles can be mapped into the same position in the corresponding nominals.",
        "Indeed, nominaLs derived from transitive verbs potentially bring in ambiguities, since the thematic roles of agent and patient can both be assigned to possessives and PPs of the form di NP (e.g., agent: \"la telefonata di Maria\" [the telephone call by Maria) vs. patient: \"remissione di nuove azioni\" [the new share issue)).",
        "Besides, note that a PP of the form di NP can discharge also other roles, for instance an oblique such as material (e.g. \"la costruzione di mattoni\" [the construction made of bricks]).",
        "Furthermore, it can be used to express roles in relations that are not necessarily part of an argument structure, such as possession.",

        "Therefore, we want to know when a bridging can be safely posited and how to resolve it.",
        "To this aim, 'minimal' descriptions are best suited because they trigger the hypothesis that there is a bridging in a reduced number of cases, with a higher degree of certainty and provide precise information for its resolution.",
        "We capitalise on the observation that in the interpretation of a nominalisation there are preferences in the assignment of a certain thematic role in a certain context, and that one of the basic complements appears to be singled out.",
