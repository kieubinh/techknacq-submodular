        "Three applications have driven the design of the system.",
        "These are: 1) the creation of training data for automatic derivation of reference resolution algorithms (Le., machine learning), 2) the formation of a testbed for evaluating proposed reference generation and anaphora resolution theories, and 3) the development of theories about understanding reference in dialog.",
        "The influence that these three areas have upon the functional requirements of an annotation system are discussed below.",
        "In this paper we first describe the requirements that each of these three related applications demand from a discourse annotation tool geared to aid in answering questions concerning reference.",
        "We next discuss some of the theoretical implications and decisions concerning the tool development that have arisen from these requirements.",
        "Next we describe the tool itself.",

        "A successful learner will output a model which, when given only (E, F), can predict the value of C, that is, classify the instance, as positive or negative.",
        "We intend to use the annotation tool to produce a set of such instances and features.",
        "The first requirement for a tool which would help us generate such a body of data is that it must allow us to mark all the potential referring expressions.",
        "This simply means that the user will have the ability to delineate any span of text which represents a DE, and treat that span as a single entity.",

        "From the generation perspective, we look for answers to questions concerning when it is appropriate to generate a pronoun versus some other anaphoric expression (e.g., a definite description or name; see McCoy & Strube (1999a).",
        "McCoy & Strobe (1999b)).",
        "Some researchers have looked at the question of when to generate a pronoun (versus some other description) (e.g., McDonald (1980), McKeown (1983), McKeown (1985), Appelt (1981)).",
        "In this work the decision was based on a notion of focus of attention (Sidner, 1979) – if an entity was the focus of the previous sentence and is the focus of the current sentence, then use a pronoun.",
        "To evaluate such claims, not only must co-reference relations be marked in a text, but information concerning focusing data structures must be kept.",
        "Dale (1992) discussed the generation of pronouns in the context of work on generating referring expressions (Appelt, 1985; Reiter, 1990).",
        "Dale suggests the principles of efficiency and adequacy which favor generating the smallest referring expression that distinguishes the object in question from all others in the context.",
        "This notion was somewhat altered in Dale & Reiter (1995) to more adequately reflect human-generated referring expressions and to be more computationally tractable.",
        "Other researchers have suggested that a notion of discourse structure must be taken into account when generating referring expressions.",
        "In particular, Grosz & Sidner (1986) and Reichman (1985) both suggest that a full noun phrase might be generated at discourse segment boundaries when a pronoun might have been adequate (in Dale's sense).",

        "These include discourse segment boundaries and sets of \"confusable\" DE's contained in the focus space.",
        "Thus the definition of what constitutes a discourse segment is another item which is open to research; our tool should allow for alternative markings of discourse segments so that various algorithms can be evaluated.",
        "For example, in our current work we look at changes in time as segment boundaries.",
        "Other definitions are possible.",
        "So, the tool must be able to keep information for various alternative algorithms.",
        "While it is intuitively appealing that notions of discourse segmentation affect pronoun generation, the above work fails to identify how a discourse segment should be defined to a generation algorithm – thus it is not clear how this work can be applied to the generation process.",
        "Given this previous work, we need a tool that will al",
        "low us to specify (1) alternative definitions of discourse segmentation, and (2) alternative algorithms for pronoun versus definite description generation (and anaphora resolution).",
        "The tool must have the ability to then calculate statistics so that the alternative definitions and algorithms can be compared.",
        "Thus, this application requires the ability to specify co-reference relations, associate various features with referring expressions (both syntactic and discourse-relevant), calculate the results of certain well-specified algorithms on the referring expressions, and tabulate the results of such algorithms.",
        "In addition to this information on referring expressions themselves, the tool must allow the marking of arbitrary features over arbitrary pieces of text (e.g., for alternative definitions of discourse segments).",

        "Clicking on an expression with the mouse displays the features of that expression and highlights all other expressions in the text which co-refer with it.",

        "Easy visualization of the co-reference equivalence classes could aid the user as he clicks through the text and sees how the co-reference chains thread through discourse.",
        "A byproduct of the built-in flexibility of REFEREE is the ability to use different feature \"masks\" in case the user only wants to consider some subset of the complete set of marked features.",
        "For example, the user can configure the tool to display and allow changes to only the pronominalization feature.",
        "Then, the irrelevant features are not displayed and cannot be changed until the tool is reconfigured.",
        "This is also useful for associating different feature sets with different kinds of expressions.",
        "Segment mode allows the user to break the text into arbitrarily nesting and overlapping segments.",
        "(These do not have to correspond to any certain definition of discourse segment or text segment.)",
        "This allows the user the freedom to choose any degree of constraints upon the structure.",
        "When the user selects a region and clicks on the \"mark\" button, a new segment is created spanning that region.",
        "Thus, we can build up a list of start and end points of segments, and automatically determine which segments are contained in or overlap with which other segments.",
        "A separate window displays graphically the start and end point of each segment.",
        "At first glance, this seems to replicate the functionality of the reference mode, since both modes allow unconstrained marking (of contiguous text spans).",
        "The important difference is that in reference mode, the user delineates referrable entities, while in segment mode, the user is marking spans which represent the structure of discourse.",
        "So, a user could have many spans marked as segments which exactly coincide with markables in reference mode; this simply represents the fact that the user believes it is possible for the text to refer to the segments or the propositions they express.",
        "Still, the segment markings are not superfluous.",
        "They impose a structure on top of the reference mode markables, even if some of them coincide.",
        "(While this could be simulated in the reference mode by adding a binary feature for segmenthood, the visualization of segments would be lost, as would the decoupling of the two kinds of spans we mark.)",
        "The last mode of interaction with REFEREE is dialog mode.",
        "This allows the user to code a dialog by breaking it into turns.",
        "Each dialog participant's turn can be broken into utterances which may be labeled as initiation or response units.",
        "(In some cases, there is overlap between these two dialog acts.)",
        "The most important function of dialog mode, as it relates to understanding reference in spoken language is to allow segmentation of the dialog into turns assigned to one speaker or the other.",
        "Recall the proper closure of a turn is crucial for determining which DE's are in the shared discourse model.",

        "We hope to add more complex feature-extraction rules that search the parse tree more extensively for syntactic features ttlat are evident from the tree structure.",
        "We are also interested in using a lexicalized knowledge base to find semantic relationships between the marked expressions.",
        "We believe that the requirements of the intended applications dictate the design of a novel and unique tool for the analysis of the relationship between discourse structure and reference.",
        "Referee fills this niche, and greatly reduces the workload placed on the human users.",
