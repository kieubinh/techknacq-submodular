        "The study of coreference in generative linguistics has led to a very strong emphasis on how the hierarchical structure of sentences interacts with the form of referring expressions to constrain coreference (Chomsky, 1986; Reinhart, 1976).",
        "The resulting principles, embodied in the Binding Theory, provide rules that are of some use to researchers in natural-language processing because they provide information about disjoint reference – what an expression cannot refer to in certain circumstances.",
        "However, beyond that use theoretical work on the Binding Theory does not directly bear on questions central to language processing.",
        "Questions of how to resolve potentially ambiguous expression such as pronouns, or how meaning more generally is built up incrementally from linguistic expressions in context, are beyond its scope.",
        "We (Gordon & Hendrick, 1997; 1999) have used the basic methods of experimental psychology to take a close look at the phenomena of coreference and disjoint reference involving full expressions (names and descriptions) that have been cited in support of Principle C of the Binding Theory.'",
        "The results show that the interaction of form of referring expression and language structure is far simpler than it has been taken to be in the Binding Theory.",
        "Further, results on the judged acceptability of different configurations of referential expressions are consistent with the results of experiments that use reading time as 'an, online measure of language comprehension (Gordon, Grosz & Gilliom, 1993; Gordon, Hendrick, Ledoux & Yang, 1999).",
        "Further, those results are consistent with the frequency of different types of coreferential configurations in corpora of naturally-occurring language (Arid, 1994; Carden, 1982; van Hoek, 1997).",
        "The pattern of • coreference that is observed with these three types of measures (intuitive judgments, reading • time, and frequency in a corpus) is accounted for by a model (Gordon & Hendrick, 1998) that incorporates aspects of Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi, & Weinstein, 1995) into Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp & Reyle, 1993).",
        ".1, Principle C of the Binding Theory states that an r-expression cannot have a c-commanding antecedent.",
        "A constituent a is said to .c-command another constituent /3 if the first branching node that dominates a dominates f3 as well.",
        "Research in psycholinguistics, both ours and that of others, supports a fairly simple generalization concerning the ease of establishing coreference in sequences of different forms of referring expressions.",
        "Coreference is most easily established in name-pronoun sequences, less easily established in name-name sequences, and least easily established in pronoun-name sequences.",
        "An example of these types of sequences taken from Gordon and Hendrick (1997) is shown below along with the proportion of naïve subjects (college students at the University of North Carolina) who judged that it was grammatically acceptable for the expressions in boldface to refer to the same person.",
        "John's roommates met him at the shop.",
        ".94 John's roommates met John at the shop.",
        ".37 His roommates met John at the shop.",
        ".23 It should be noted that according to the Binding Theory coreference ought to be acceptable in all the• sentences shown above; for both the name-name and pronoun-name sequence the second referring expression does not• have a c-commanding antecedent and therefore should be free to corefer with the first referring expression.2 This is one example of consistent differences that we found between the accepted empirical predictions of the Binding Theory and the quantitatively analyzed judgments of competent native speakers who were naive to linguistic theory.",
        "In Gordon and Hendrick (1997; 1999) we find that this pattern of relative acceptability between the different types of sequences is shown for categorical judgments, for ratings of grammaticality, for isolated sentences, for sentences in discourse context, and for different types of unreduced expressions including names, 2 Attempts like that of Kayne (1994) to reformulate the definition of c-command to account for the unacceptability of his roomates_met john at the shop do not explain the improved status of John's roomates met John at the shop.",
        "definite NPs and quantified NPs.3 This pattern is also supported by on-line measures of reading time which show that under certain conditions sentences with repeated names are read more slowly than matched sentences with pronouns (Gordon, et al.",
        "1993; Kennison & Gordon, 1997); similar patterns of this reading elevation are observed within sentences and between sentences (Gordon, Hendrick, Ledoux & Yang, 1999).",
        "The similarity of results that we observe with judgments of coreference and with on-line measures of reading time suggest that judgments of acceptable coreference reflect the ease in terms of mental processing with which a sentence can be understood.",
        "The similarity of results that we observe in the factors that influence the ease of establishing coreference within and between sentences suggests that the same mechanisms may be used for the two types of coreferential processing.",
        "The finding by Aridl (1994) that repeated-name coreference is far less common than pronominal coreference in a naturally occurring corpus suggests that our conjecture about the relative ease in terms of cognitive processes of establishing coreference for different types of sequences helps to understand how people use different forms of coreferential expressions.",
        "For name-pronoun and name-name sequences, the pattern of acceptable coreference is modified by the structural prominence of the antecedent (first) referring expression.",
        "Here, we take structural prominence to mean the inverse of depth of syntactic embeddedness.",
        "An example, again from Gordon and Hendrick (1997), is shown below along with the proportion of subjects who judged that it was grammatically acceptable for the expressions in boldface to refer to the same person.",

        ".24 For name-pronoun sequences, coreference is more acceptable when the antecedent is .more 3 Our findings make English look more similar to the survey of crosslinguistic variation in pronoun-quantified NP sequences in Bresnan (1998).",
        "prominent (e.g., a subject) than when it is less prominent (a possessive), while for name-name sequences the opposite is true.",
        "Gordon and Hendrick (1997) found that this pattern holds for a number of manipulations of prominence: subject NP versus object NP, subject NP versus a component NP of a pair of conjoined NPs, and subject NP versus an NP in a relative clause.",
        "Gordon, et al.",
        "(1999) showed similar patterns in relative reading times for cases of both intersentential and intrasentential coreference.",
        "Our studies of coreference have mostly focused on understanding contrasts in the comprehension of full and reduced referring expressions.",
        "The results that we have obtained in those comparisons are consistent with other theoretical and methodological approaches.",
        "Research on psychological heuristics for interpreting ambiguous pronouns has provided support for a subject-assignment strategy, where a pronoun is preferentially interpreted as coreferential with the subject of the preceding clause (Crawley, Stevenson, & Kleinman, 1990; Fzedericksen, 1981); in our framework, the subject of a sentence has the most structural prominence.",
        "Research on the success of algorithms for pronoun resolution (Lappin & Leass, 1994) shows that syntactic factors (such as being a subject, being a direct object, and not being contained within another noun phrase) contribute to the likelihood that an expression is the antecedent of a subsequent pronoun."

        "The work reported here argues that allowable coreference emerges from how construction rules for interpreting different types of noun phrases interact dynamically with a structure representing the meaning of a discourse.",
        "Further, it is argued that interpretation of coreferential expressions within and between sentences is done in a uniform manner, making use of the same construction rules and ,principles of discourse representation.",
        "'This manner favors the use of pronouns compared to proper names for reference to prominent entities in a discourse.",
        "The model that is developed – Discourse Prominence Theory (DPT) – integrates and elaborates on three theoretical sources: Discourse Representation Theory (DRT, Kamp & Reyle, 1993), Centering Theory (Grosz, et al.",
        "1995), and the Binding Theory (Chomsky, 1986).",
        "DRT is adopted as a formalism because it provides explicit mechanisms for mapping linguistic input onto semantic representations.",
        "Further, syntactic forms play an important role in the characterization of the linguistic input to the DRT construction rules and syntax clearly plays an important role in coreference.",
        "Finally, DRT describes semantic interpretation as an incremental process in which the interpretation of an utterance involves a dynamic interaction of the characteristics of the utterance with the discourse universe that represents the meanings created from the earlier utterances in the discourse.",
        "Beyond its usefulness in providing a satisfactory semantics, of discourse, this dynamic view of language processing makes DRT attractive as a framework for characterizing the psychological processes of .",
        "language comprehension which are generally regarded as dynamic and incremental.",
        "Centering Theory provides key theoretical notions for understanding how reference and the form of referring expressions contribute to discourse coherence.",
        "DPT directly incorporates the idea of a set of forward-looking centers (CO in order to explain how structural prominence affects the interpretation of pronouns and repeated full expressions.",
        "This incorporation extends the role of the Cf so that it plays a role in the interpretation of referential expressions within an utterance as well as between utterances in a discourse segment.",
        "The idea of a backward-looking center (Cb) is not directly incorporated into the representation of discourse within DPT.",
        "Instead, the characteristics of the Cb emerge from how the model integrates an utterance into the current discourse universe and thereby linking.",
        "it to the current discourse segment.",
        "The preference for realizing the Cb as a pronoun occurs because the construction rule for pronouns (CR.Pro) interprets a pronoun as referring to an entity in the current discourse representation and therefore forces integration of the utterance into the current discourse representation.",
        "Absent a clear cue for integration, such as a pronoun, there is always the possibility that the utterance is the beginning of a new discourse segment and should not be integrated into the current discourse universe.",
        "The existence of only a single Cb in an utterance occurs because a single pronominal reference is sufficient to force the integration of an entire utterance into the current discourse universe.",
        "The Binding Theory contributes to DPT through its emphasis on how the syntactic characteristics of the antecedent influence patterns of coreference.",
        "While this is the case, it is obvious that the work that we have reviewed is not consistent empirically with the generalizations typically modeled by the binding theorists.",
        "Coreference phenomena appear to be simpler than the binding theorists have taken them to be, and accordingly the effects of syntactic factors on allowable coreference emerge from the nature of the mechanisms posited in DPT for achieving coreferential interpretations.",
        "The discrepancies that we observed between the empirical characterizations of the Binding Theory and those obtained using more systematic experimental techniques deserve some comment given the current emphasis in computational linguistics on appropriate empirical methods.",
        "We (Gordon & Hendrick, 1997) found that there were striking differences between what was seen as acceptable coreference in the linguistics literature and what emerged from quantitative analysis of judgments that were systematically obtained from subjects who were naive to syntactic theory.",
        "Further, the view of coreference that emerged from the judgments of naïve subjects was consistent with online measures of language comprehension and with analysis of corpus data.",
        "We believe that this consistency points to the usefulness of considering the kinds of intuitive judgments that have traditionally been used in trying to develop theories of linguistic competence.",
        "However, we also believe that it demonstrates the need for careful methodology in collecting intuitive judgments.",
        "Because of substantial variation in judgments about coreference, and because of the centrality of the theoretical issues at stake, claims about the favored or acceptable interpretations of linguistic expressions in discourse need to be supported by quantitatively analyzed data obtained from subjects who are naive to the hypotheses being investigated.",
        "Data on such intuitive judgments can only provide a stable, cumulative basis for theoretical development if they are collected with such methods."
