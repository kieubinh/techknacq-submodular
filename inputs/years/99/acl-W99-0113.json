      "text": [
        "To begin with, we should state explicitly that our enterprise is a semantic one: we are interested in developing and implementing a formalization capable of assigning a correct interpretation to each utterance in a discourse.",
        "In this, we are fully committed to the Dynamic Semantics enterprise (Kamp 1981, Heim 1982, Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1990, 1991, Chier-chia 1992, van den Berg 1991, Kamp and Reyle 1993, Asher 1993, van den Berg 1996).",
        "Except in so far as it is provably necessary, we are not concerned with psychological issues of how human language users process discourse nor with what human beings intend when they use language to communicate with one another.",
        "Our aim is to build machinery applicable to all genres and all modes of communication.",
        "Thus we can not assume that a discourse is necessarily \"coherent\" and that our goal is to provide an account of why that is so, nor can we assume that all discourse is written or spoken or occurs in a task context where the demands.",
        "or reasonable expectations of an external activity are available to guide parsing and interpretation.",
        "Our theory is a formal one, therefore we can rely on well-known, rule-driven, parsing methods developed for sentences which allows us to parse discourse incrementally as it unfolds.",
        "In order to do so, our framework formalizes the relationship among constituent units in the discourse by specifying how antecedent units provide context for the interpretation of later units.",
        "In all cases, our method involves computing the resulting meaning of the combination of the meanings of the combined units, rather than identifying appropriate labels under which to characterize the relationship obtaining between the units.",
        "Our units of analysis are well defined semantic units.",
        "These units are usually encoded as single simple sentences or clauses but may also be realized by words, phrases or gestures which communicate exactly one elementary predication.",
        "In our view, a formal theory of discourse structure should give well defined structures on which inferencing operates and on which world knowledge applies.",
        "We strive to limit the role of world knowledge in so far as possible to a specific moment in discourse processing – namely at the precise moment when a choice must be made about how a newly incoming unit must be integrated into the unfolding discourse.",
        "Just as in sentence grammar where world knowledge is used to decide between syntactically equivalent alternatives in the case of PP attachment, for example, in discourse grammar the relationships between elements are purely grammatical, and world knowledge is only used to decide between syntactically equally reasonable alternatives.",
        "Similarly, in calculating the structure of discourse, we do not rely on the use a cue words such as so, anyway or therefore, because these terms are never obligatory.",
        "The relationship of one unit to another is always calculated on the relationship between the meanings of the constituent utterances which may then be reinforced by the presence of terms which specify the nature of the intended relationship.",
        "In the framework developed below, there is a close relationship between discourse referents and discourse structure.",
        "We deal both with how anaphors are resolved to particular antecedents using the structure of the discourse, and how an antecedent gives meaning to an anaphor.",
        "The problem of identifying the antecedent to which an anaphor refers is dealt with in Centering Theory, discussed in Section 2 below.",
        "After reviewing Centering, we will discuss Dynamic Quantifier Logic (Section 3) and then show how the insights of Centering can be integrated into a general theory of discourse syntactic and semantic structure (Section 5.1), We shall point out how our approach accounts for multiple anaphors to different antecedents as well as accounting for anaphoric reference to multiple antecedents, a problem which remain unsolved within that framework (5.2)."

        "Looking towards formal discourse systems, we believe that while it would be possible to integrate the insights of DQL into a DlT approach such as that taken by Asher (1993), the approach taken here is computationally more tractable than more standard implementation of DRT for discourse parsing.",
        "The increased tractability results from the separation of discourse syntax and semantics which our approach imposes, taken together with the restriction of appeals to inference and world knowledge to specific moments in interpretation.",
        "In the case of the LDM, appeals to external knowledge are made only at the moment of DCU attachment to the parse tree."
