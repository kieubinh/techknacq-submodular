        "This paper introduces a methodology to analyse and resolve cases of coreference in dialogues in English and Portuguese.",
        "A four-attribute annotation to analyse cases of anaphora was used to analyse a sample of around three thousand cases in each language collected in dialogue corpora.",
        "The information thus gathered was analysed by means of exploratory and model-building statistical procedures.",
        "A probabilistic model was then built on the basis of aggregate combinations of categories across the four attributes.",
        "This model, in combination with direct observation of cases, was used to build an antecedent-likelihood theory, which is at present being organised as a decision tree for the purpose of testing with a view for automatic annotation and subsequent resolution of coreference cases in dialogues in both languages.",

      "text": [
        "The problem of anaphora resolution has received a great deal of attention in theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics and also in natural language processing.",
        "Perhaps as an inevitable consequence of such a large body of work related to the subject, the term anaphora has been used to mean a varying range of phenomena.",
        "Approaches that build on the concept of cohesion ties (Halliday and Hasan 1976) analyse anaphoric relations within a broad framework of discourse or textual cohesion.",
        "As a result, the notion of anaphora, which had been initially linked quite closely to the older concept of pronominalisation, has been expanded to include all referring expressions with some form of antecedent either explicitly introduced in the text or inferable from it.",
        "In an earlier study, Webber (1979) had already widened the scope of anaphoric relations, by including nonpronominal noun phrases which refer back to antecedents in the discourse; the so-called one-anaphora; and verb-phrase deletions.",
        "Gradually, the distinction between anaphoric and coreference relations became less and less relevant in approaches concerned with robust implementation of systems with a capacity for anaphora resolution.",
        "The present study follows the same sort of approach.",
        "Therefore, the term coreference in the present study is used to refer to all pronominal forms, anaphoric nonpronominal noun phrases, one anaphora, numerals when used as heads of noun phrases, prepositional phrases used as responses to questions or statements, responses to questions in general (including yes, no and short answers using auxiliaries), so anaphora, do-phrase anaphora and whatever other elements in dialogues were thought to be referring expressions with an identifiable antecedent.",
        "The next section describes the annotation scheme used to analyse the coreference cases.",
        "The third section presents the antecedent-likelihood (henceforth, AL) theory, which is the way information collected by means of the annotation was organised so as to be used to resolve new cases of coreference in other dialogues.",
        "The decision trees which are to be built on the basis of the AL theory are explained in the subsequent section, whereas the final",
        "section concludes with a discussion of results obtained so far and an analysis of future developments.",
        "2 The annotation of coreference cases The operational routine of data collection was simply to search manually for tokens which coreferred in dialogue samples.",
        "Samples consisted of full dialogues for Portuguese but not for English, as a result of the sampling technique used in the English corpus (the London-Lund).",
        "Whenever a case of coreference was found, it was classified, according to four attributes, namely: type of anaphor; type of antecedent; topical role of the antecedent; and processing strategy.",
        "The first attribute refers to the word or phrase which triggers the anaphoric link, that is, the visible item that requires the retrieval of another element in the text for semantic interpretation.",
        "Concepts such as zero pronouns or empty categories are not used in the classification.",
        "Thus, the anaphor is invariably a phonetically realised item, and a verb without a phonetically realised subject is classified as an anaphoric verb.",
        "Although such verbal forms are rare in English, they are fairly common in spoken Portuguese.",
        "The same approach is used for transitive verbs without a phonetically realised object, which are also frequent.",
        "The type of antecedent concerns primarily the implicit/explicit dichotomy.",
        "Typically anaphoric words, such as it and that, may occur in nonreferential uses â€“ for instance, the 'prop' it (Quirk et al.",
        "1985).",
        "Thus, a third category, nonreferential, was used to classify these cases.",
        "Although these are not cases of coreference strictu sensu, it was thought important to include them, so that they could be identified when it came to implementation.",
        "Some tokens of pronouns with a vague antecedent identifiable by means of inference based on discourse information were classified as discourse implicit antecedents.",
        "The attribute named as the topical role of the antecedent classifies the antecedent of a given coreference case according to categories which assign a saliency status to discourse entities (typically noun phrases) in a dialogue.",
        "These categories include a discourse topic for the dialogue; a segment topic for every stretch of dialogue in which the topic is considered to be the same, according to specific procedures; a subsegment topic, if further division within a segment is needed for the appropriate modelling of topicality; and both global and local thematic elements, which are salient discourse entities related to the topics above mentioned.",
        "As antecedents may also be discourse chunks of varying length, these same categories were used to classify such antecedents as predicates of a given topical role thought to be the dominant entity within the discourse chunk.",
        "The aim of this attribute is to use the often mentioned relationship between topicality and coreference (see Grosz and Sidner 1986) for operational purposes.",
        "This classification does not claim to be the actual key for the modelling of topicality in dialogues from a psycholinguistic point of view.",
        "It does claim, however, to be a useful tool for the resolution of particularly hard cases of coreference, in which the antecedent is not the nearest syntactically appropriate candidate, as will be shown in section 3.",
        "The topical roles are assigned on the basis of frequency, distribution and order of appearance.",
        "This information is used in conjunction with an adaptation for dialogues of Hoey's method (Hoey 1991) to establish patterns of lexis.",
        "Procedures were thus defined for the assignment of the topical roles above mentioned to the various discourse entities in a dialogue.",
        "The fourth attribute is the processing strategy, which is an attempt to classify the resolution path according to informational demands seen as the most essential for the processing at hand.",
        "The processing strategy was included in the annotation scheme as a way of enriching the classification model, uncovering distinctions which might remain unnoticed if only the type of anaphor were to be specified.",
        "The plain assignment of a type of anaphor based on word classes would ignore distinctions in the processing required for the resolution of anaphors of the same type.",
        "On the other hand,",
        "subsuming processing information in the classification used for the type of anaphor would disrupt the intended link of the latter to phonetically realised forms in a strict way.",
        "The annotation is entered between brackets in the order previously presented, beginning with the type of anaphor and ending with the processing strategy.",
        "The code for each one of the properties is delimited by semicolons.",
        "An example of annotated text is shown below.",
        "The first token of coreference is the anaphoric nonpronominal noun phrase Captain Kay, which has been previously introduced in the dialogue.",
        "The type of anaphor is classified as FNP, for full noun phrase; the next slot defines the type of antecedent as explicit (exi and assigns a number for the referent according to order of appearance in the dialogue (222).",
        "The topical role of the antecedent is considered to be of a discourse thematic element.",
        "This means, thus, that Captain Kay is a fairly frequent discourse entity not only in a specific stretch of discourse, but throughout the dialogue, being, therefore, closely associated to the discourse topic.",
        "As the reference to Captain Kay is identified by means of verbatim repetition of the noun form under which it appeared for the first time in the dialogue, the processing strategy is defined as lexical repetition (LR).",
        "The subsequent anaphoric it refers to the first syntactically appropriate candidate looking backwards.",
        "Having Hobbs' (1986) naive algorithm as a reference, a primary first-candidate processing strategy was established under the code FtC.",
        "An extension of this primary strategy is the first-candidate chain (FtCCh), for cases in which Hobbs' naive algorithm fmds another anaphor for antecedent.",
        "This sort of chain is crucially important in dialogues, as demonstrated by Biber (1992).",
        "An example is given below'.",
        "B: and I went down this morning to talk to the American Embassy on the off chance that the State Department might be you know able to finance a bit of travelling in the States and they can't they've (SP; ex /3; st; FtCCh;) got priority on vice-chancellors and uh English schoolteachers The second token of they refers to the first one, which, eventually, links both anaphors to the referent State Department.",
        "The two first-candidate processing strategies, together with resolutions relying on syntactic parallelism, were grouped under the umbrella category named syntactic processes.",
        "As the analysis of anaphora cases found in the corpus proceeded, a number of other categories for the classification of the processing strategy came up.",
        "These included, for instance, collocational knowledge (CK), for cases in which the basic information required for processing was thought to derive from the use of anaphors within crystallised phrases, such as that is to say.",
        "Example (3) is one of those cases.",
        "B: the bibliography has gone about as far as I can take it on my own that (De;",
        "States and uh several in Europe Annotation for other cases of coreference is omitted.",
        "By collecting these phrases in association with each type of anaphor, a collocation list of anaphoric terms was built for each one of the types, with a resolution procedure attached, which was designed on the basis of corpus data observation.",
        "This list was subsequently used as an ancillary routine in the AL theory, as will be shown later.",
        "Several forms of lexical knowledge, assigned to cases in which the antecedents were identified chiefly by means of semantic information contained in the anaphor, were also identified, such as part-whole relationshps.",
        "In example (4), monies refers to finances by means of information conveyed by the lexical semantics contained in the lexical item itself, but not by means of plain repetition.",
        "Thus, the classification used is lexical signalling (LS), one of the categories within the umbrella category lexical knowledge, along with lexical repetition.",
        "B: and uh - you know my own personal finances are A: well sure B: it's just out A: but you have applied er for monies (FNP; im 12; st; LS;) I keep hearing wherever I go Finally, a category named as discourse knowledge was used to classify cases in which the resolution required full processing of combined bits of discourse information.",
        "These four broader categories, including the essentially syntactic information required for the first-candidate strategies, grouped more fine-grained subclassifications in all cases, except for collocational knowledge.",
        "Thus, the umbrella categories were used to perform a statistical analysis using the data collected by means of manual annotation.",
        "However, the more detailed classification was retained in the actual annotation of the sample.",
        "The same approach was used in the other attributes.",
        "Frequencies for each category were then used in three different statistical procedures: a chi-square test; a measure of association; and the model-building variety of loglinear analysis.",
        "Chi-square tests with the attributes considered two by two showed statistical significance in all measurements (p < 0.00005) in both languages.",
        "The Goodman and Kruskal tau was used to measure association between attributes two by two.",
        "Association was shown to be high (over 0.30) between the processing strategy and the other three attributes, but relatively low (under 0.30) between these three attributes measured two by two.",
        "The loglinear analysis revealed that interactions considering three of the attributes were significant whenever the processing strategy was one of the three.",
        "The opposite was true when it was not.",
        "These results were true for both languages with minor variations.",
        "The statistical analysis showed thus that the classification model was adequate to represent the anaphora world.",
        "Moreover, it became clear that the attribute named as processing strategy yielded the highest information gain, acting as a link between the type of anaphor and the other two attributes which classify the antecedent.",
        "Therefore, the type of anaphor in itself, which could be mapped from POS tags or, in some cases, skeleton parsing (see Mitkov 1997), only became truly useful information for the resolution of the anaphoric reference when associated to the definition of a processing strategy.",
        "This made of course psycholinguistic sense, as it is not difficult to infer from corpus data that the same anaphor (such as it or that) may appear in contexts that lead to distinct processing demands for their resolution."
