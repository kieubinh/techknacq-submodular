        "Nowadays there is a growing research activity centred in automated processing of texts on electronic form.",
        "One of the most common problems in this field is co-reference resolution, i.e. the way of knowing when, in one or more texts, different descriptions refer to the same entity.",
        "A full co-reference resolution is difficult to achieve and too computationally demanding; moreover, in many applications it is enough to group the majority of co-referential expressions (expressions with the same referent) by means of a partial analysis.",
        "Our research is focused in co-reference resolution restricted to proper names, and we part from the definition of a new relation called \"replicancia\".",
        "Though replicancia relation does not coincide extensionally nor intensionally with identity, attending to the tests we have carried out, the error produced when we take the replicantes as co-referents is admissible in those applications which need systems where a very high speed of processing takes priority."

        "The proliferation of texts on electronic form during the last two decades has livened up the interest in Information Retrieval and given rise to new disciplines such as Information Extraction or automatic summarization.",
        "These three disciplines have in common the operation of Natural Language Processing techniques (Jacobs and Rau, 1993), which thus can evolve synergically.",
        "Identification and treatment of noun phrases is one of the fields of interest shared both by Information Retrieval and Information Extraction.",
        "Such interest must be understood within the trend to carry out only partial analysis of texts so as to process them in a reasonable time (Chinchor et al., 1993).",
        "The present work proposes a new instrument designed for the treatment of proper nouns and other simple noun phrases in texts written in Spanish language.",

        "Information Retrieval systems aim to discriminate between the documents which form the system's entry, according to the information need posed by the user.",
        "In the field of Information Retrieval we can find two different approaches: information filtering or routing and retrospective, also known as ad hoc.",
        "In the first modality, the information need remains fixed and the documents which form the entry are always new.",
        "The ad hoc modality retrieves relevant texts from a relative static set of documents but, in contrast, admits changing information needs (Oard, 1996).",
        "Information Retrieval systems make up representations of the texts and compare them with the representation of the information need raised by the user.",
        "The representation form most commonly used is a vector whose coordinates depend on the terms' frequency of occurrence, where such \"terms\" are elements of the text represented which can coincide with words, stems or words associations (n-grams) (Evans and Zhai, 1996).",
        "At the present time designers try to enrich the sets of terms used in the representations with",
        "noun phrases or parts of them as, for example, proper names.",
        "Thompson and Dozier conclude in (Thompson and Dozier, 1997) that: first, the recognition of proper nouns in the texts can be done with remarkable effectiveness; second, proper nouns occur frequently enough as well as in queries' to warrant their separate treatment in document retrieval, at least when working with case law documents or press news; third, the inclusion of proper nouns as terms in the documents' representations can improve information retrieval when proper nouns appear in the query.",
        "As Gerald Salton has noted (Salton and Allan, 1995), in the field of information retrieval to determine the meaning of words is not as important as to ascertain if the meaning of the terms within the detection need coincide or not with the meaning of the terms in each document.",
        "When the terms are proper nouns we shall not talk about meaning but of reference, so that it will be interesting to know if the referents of the proper nouns included in the query coincide or not with the referents of the proper nouns which appear in each document.",
        "Referents' resolution can not be done without an additional context (Thompson and Dozier, 1997).",
        "Nonetheless, in an Information Retrieval process we can not count on the additional information of a data base register, such as personal identification number, profession or age.",
        "Nor can we make a linguistic analysis as thorough as can be done in a language understanding system or in an Information Extraction system.",
        "Because of these reasons, the identification of proper nouns as co-references is usually confined to verify if the superficial forms of the two nouns under examination are close enough as to suppose that both of them refer to the same individual or entity."

        "In this work we propose a tool to resolve proper nouns co-reference, based only on the exam of those nouns' superficial form.",

        "For example, let us say that noun A designates to Jose Salazar Fernandez, noun B to JSF and name C to Juan Sanchez Figueroa; in this case A is a replicante of B and B a replicante of C, but A is not a replicante of C. Not being a transitive relation, the replicancia is neither an equivalence relation and does not induce a set of equivalence classes as it had been desirable (Hirsman, 1997).",

        "Replicancia and co-reference do not coincide neither extensionally nor intensionally.",

        "The result is that one class of replicancia may contain names which refer to different entities and, however, not contain names which refer to the entity associated to the class.",
        "Despite what it has been said, as the calculation of replicancia is much more simple than the calculation of coreferences, it is interesting, and even convenient, to calculate replicancia between nouns in limited contexts.",

        "We can notice that the median take values between eight and nine points above average, which means that in most documents the co-reference between proper nouns is successfully decided.",
        "The negative burden comes from the variance, close to 25% of the recall and precision total values, which, along with the difference between average and median, forces us to think that most of mistakes are concentrated in some documents, in which precision and recall can be much smaller than expected.",
        "In Figure 5.1 we have represented the histogram of the group of values obtained for F measure, values included in the right column in table I-1.",
        "It can be noted that more than half of the documents subject to evaluation obtain an F-measure over 0.9, and more than two thirds are over 0.8.",
        "The statistical analysis of the system's quality measures is not enough to guarantee the representativity of the sample.",

        "The last five linles of table I-1, Annex I, register the total results distributed according to the documents origin.",
        "The mistakes detected are mainly due to two causes: the presence of co-referents which are not replicantes and the presence of replicantes which are not co-referents, as sometimes it occurs with initials.",
