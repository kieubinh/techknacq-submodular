        "According to Mitkov (1996), the establishment of the antecedents of anaphora is of crucial importance for a correct translation.",
        "It is essential to solve the anaphoric relation when a language is translated into one that marks the pronoun gender.",
        "On the other hand, anaphora resolution is vital when translating discourse rather than isolated sentences since the anaphoric references to preceding discourse entities have to be identified.",
        "Unfortunately, the majority of Machine Translation (MT) systems do not deal with anaphora resolution and their successful operation usually does not go beyond the sentence level.",
        "Another important aspect in automatic translation of pronouns, as mentioned in Mitkov (1996), consists on the application of two possible techniques: translation or reconstruction of referential expressions.",
        "In the first technique, source language pronouns are directly translated into target language pronouns without studying their relation with other words in the text.",
        "The second technique considers that the pronouns are not autonomous in their meaning/function but dependent on other units in the text.",
        "Then, a more natural way to treat pronouns in MT would be the following: (a) analysis has to determine the reference structure of the source text, i.e. coreference/ cospecification relationships between anaphora and antecedents have to be determined, (b) this is the only information that is conveyed to the target language generator, (c) the target language generator generates the appropriate target language surface expression as a function of the target equivalent of the source antecedent and/or according to the rules of this language.",
        "Mitkov et al.",
        "(1995) adopt a similar approach.",
        "In this work, we present an Interlingual (formal language without ambiguity) mechanism proposal based on the second technique.",
        "Basically, a structure that stores the anaphora and its antecedent in the source language is used.",
        "From this structure, a similar one in the target language is generated.",
        "Using this new structure we will be able to generate the final surface structure of the original sentence.",
        "In the following section we will describe the general purpose anaphora resolution system.",
        "The following section will show the anaphora resolution module, where we will focus on the differences between English and Spanish system and we will report some evaluation results.",
        "After that, we will present our Interlingual mechanism based on the English-Spanish discrepancy analysis.",
