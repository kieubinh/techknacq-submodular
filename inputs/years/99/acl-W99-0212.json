        "Search engines have become ubiquitous as a means for accessing information.",
        "When a ranking of documents is returned by a search engine the information retrieval task is usually not complete.",
        "The document, as a unit of information, is often too large for many users information needs and finding information within the set of returned documents poses a burden of its own.",
        "Here we examine a technique for extracting sentences from documents which attempts to satisfy the users information needs by providing an answer to the query presented.",
        "The system does this by modeling coreference relationships between entities and events in the query and documents.",
        "An evaluation of this system is given which demonstrates that it performs better than using a standard tf • idf weighting and that the amount of information that the user must process on average, to find an answer to their query, is reduced by an order of magnitude over document ranking alone."

      "text": [
        "A query indicates an informational need by the user to the search engine.",
        "The information required may take the form of a sentence or even a noun phrase.",
        "Here the task is to retrieve the passage of text which contains the answer to the query from a small collection of documents.",
        "Sentences are then ranked and presented to the user.",
        "We only examine queries to which answers are likely to be stated in a sentence or noun phrase since answers which are typically longer are can be difficult to annotate reliably.",
        "This technology differs from the standard document ranking task in that, if successful the user will likely not need to examine any of the retrieved documents in their entirety.",
        "This also differs from the document summarization, provided by many search engines today, in that the sentences selected are influenced by the query and are selected across multiple documents.",
        "We view a system such as ours as providing a secondary level of processing after a small set of documents, which the user believes contain the information desired, have been found.",
        "This first step would likely be provided by a traditional search engine, thus this technology serves as an enhancement to an existing document retrieval systems rather than a replacement.",
        "Advancements in document retrieval would only help the performance of a system such as ours as these improvements would increase the likelihood that the answer to the user's query is in one of the top ranked documents returned."

      "heading": "3 Approach",
      "text": [
        "A query is viewed as identifying a relation to which a user desires a solution.",
        "This relation will most likely involve events and entities, and an answer to this relation will involve the same events and entities.",
        "Our approach attempts to find coreference relationships between the entities and events evoked by the query and those evoked in the document.",
        "Based on these relationships, sentences are ranked, and the highest ranked sentences are displayed to the user.",
        "The coreference relationships that are modeled by this system include identity, part-whole,",
        "and synonymy relations.",
        "Consider the following query and answer pairs.",
        "Query: What did Mark McGwire say about child abuse?",
        "Sentence: \"What kills me is that you know there are kids over there who are being abused or neglected, you just don't know which ones\" McGwire says.",
        "In the above query answer pair the system attempts to capture the identity relationship between Mark McGwire and McGwire by determining that the term McGwire in this sentence is coreferent with a mention of Mark McGwire earlier in the document..",
        "This allows the system to rank this sentence equivalently to a sentence mentioning the full name.",
        "The system also treats the term child abuse as a nominalization which allows it to speculate that the term abused in the sentence is a related event.",
        "Finally the verb neglect occurs frequently within documents which contain the verb abuse, which is nominalized in the query, so this term is treated as a related event.",
        "The system does not currently have a mechanism which tries to capture the relationship between kids and children.",
        "Query: Why did the U.S. bomb Sudan?",
        "Sentence: Last month, the United States launched a cruise missile attack against the Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries plant in Khartoum, alleging that U.S. intelligence agencies have turned up evidence – including soil samples – showing that the plant was producing chemicals which could be used to make VX, a deadly nerve gas.",
        "In this example one of the entity-based relationships of interest is the identity relationship between U.S. and United States.",
        "Also of interest is the part-whole relationship between Sudan and Khartoum, it's capital.",
        "Finally the bomb event is related to the launch/attack event.",

        "The motivation for this comes in part from example texts where the same last name will be used to refer to different individuals in the same family.",
        "This is often unambiguous because full names are used in previous sentences, however this requires some modeling of which entities are most salient in the discourse.",
        "These relations are determined using techniques described in (Baldwin et al., 1998).",
        "Another source of identity relationships is morphological and word order variations.",
        "Within noun phrases in the query the system constructs other possible word combinations which contain the head word of the noun phrase.",
        "For example a noun phrase such as \"the photographed little trouper\" would be extended to include \"the photographed trouper\", \"the little trovper\", and \"the trouper\" as well as variations excluding the determiner.",
        "Each of the variations is given a weight based on the ratio of the score that the new shorter term would have received if it had appeared in the query and the actual noun phrase that occured.",
        "The morphological roots of single word variations are also added to the list a possible terms which refer to the entity or event with no additional deduction in weighting.",

        "The query expansion techniques presented here are simplistic compared to many used in for information retrieval however they are trying to capture different phenomenon.",
        "Here the goal is to capture different lexicalizations of the same entities and events.",
        "Since short news articles are likely to focus on a small number of entities and perhaps a single event or a group of related events it is hoped that the co-occurrence statistics gathered will reveal good candidates for alternate ways in which the query entities and events can be lexicalized.",
        "This work employs many of the techniques used by (Baldwin and Morton, 1998) for performing query based summarization.",
        "Here however the retrieved information attempts to meet the users information needs rather then helping the user determine whether the entire document being summarized possibly meets that need.",
        "This system also differs in that it can present the user with information from multiple documents.",
        "While query sensitive multi-document systems exist (Mani and Bloedorn, 1998), evaluating such systems for the purpose of comparison is difficult.",
        "Our evaluation shows that the system performs better than the baseline although the baseline performs surprisingly well.",
        "We believe that this is, in part, due to the lack of any notion of recall in the evaluation.",
        "While all queries were answered by multiple sentences, for some queries such as 4,5 and 10 it is not clear what benefit the retrieval of additional sentences would have.",
        "The baseline benefited from the fact that at least one of the answers typically contained most of the query terms.",
        "Classifying queries as single answer or multiple answer, and evaluating them separately may provide a sharper distinction in performance Comparing the users task with and without the system reveals a stark contrast in the amount of information needed to be processed.",
        "On average the system required 290 bytes of text to display the answer to the query to the user.",
