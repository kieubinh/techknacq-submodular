        "When we examine the kinds of speech transcription and annotation found in many existing 'communities of practice', we see commonality of abstract form along with diVersity of concrete format.",
        "Our survey of annotation practice (Bird and Liberman, 1999) attests to this commonality amidst diversity.",
        "(See [ww.ldc.upenn.edu/annotation] for pointers to online material.)",
        "We observed that all annotations of recorded linguistic signals require one unavoidable basic action: to associate a label, or an ordered sequence of labels, with a stretch of time in the recording(s).",
        "Such annotations also typically distinguish labels of different types, such as spoken words vs. non-speech noises.",
        "Different types of annotation often span different-sized stretches of recorded time, without necessarily forming a strict hierarchy: thus a conversation contains (perhaps overlapping) conversational turns, turns contain (perhaps interrupted) words, and words contain (perhaps shared) phonetic segments.",
        "Some types of annotation are systematically incommensurable with others: thus disfluency structures (Taylor, 1995) and focus structures (Jackendoff, 1972) often cut across conversational turns and syntactic constituents.",
        "A minimal formalization of this basic set of practices is a directed graph with fielded records on the arcs and optional time references on the nodes.",
        "We have argued that this minimal formalization in fact has sufficient expressive capacity to encode, in a reasonably intuitive way, all of the kinds of linguistic annotations in use today.",
        "We have also argued that this minimal formalization has good properties with respect to creation, maintenance and searching of annotations.",
        "We believe that these advantages are especially strong in the case of discourse annotations, because of the prevalence of cross-cutting structures and the need to compare multiple annotations representing different purposes and perspectives.",
        "Translation into annotation graphs does not magically create compatibility among systems whose semantics are different.",
        "For instance, there are many different approaches to transcribing filled pauses in English â€“ each will translate easily into an annotation graph framework, but their semantic incompatibility is not thereby erased.",
        "However, it does enable us to focus on the substantive differences without having to be concerned with diverse formats, and without being forced to recode annotations in an agreed, common format.",
        "Therefore, we focus on the structure of annotations, independently of domain-specific concerns about permissible tags, attributes, and values.",
        "As reference corpora are published for a wider range of spoken language genres, annotation work is increasingly reusing the same primary data.",

        "Once this common framework is established, via translation of all eight \"strands\" into AG graph terms, we have the basis for posing queries that cut across the different types of annotation.",

        "The power set construction provides the basis for a useful query algebra, since it defines the complete set of possible values for queries over the AG in question, and is obviously closed under intersection, union and relative complement.",
        "As another example, various time-based indexes are definable on an adequately time-anchored annotation graph, with the result that many sorts of precedence, inclusion and overlap relations are easy to calculate for arbitrary subgraphs.",
