        "Many people wish to annotate spoken dialogue cor-i)ora with coded information.",
        "This information can come in many forms for litany different purposes.",
        "Some of it will be linguistic; for instance, the annotation may represent part-of-speech information or syntactic structure, for use in language modelling.",
        "Some of it will be non-linguistic, representing information about the communicative situation or about events such as coughing or gesturing.",
        "If the dialogue being annotated is being conducted with or mediated by technology, some of it may be specific to that technology for instance, showing the results of speech recognition in line with a human transcription of the same material in order to highlight where the dialogue model broke doWn.",
        "Although some kinds of annotation, such as dialogue act information, come up again and again, it is impossible to prejudge what kinds of annotations people who work with corpora will find useful even when considering a quite restricted set of coding purposes.",
        "Currently, corpus annotation is a very costly exercise not just because of the time which it takes coders to make the coding distinctions, but also because there is little effective technological support for annotation.",
        "The MATE Workbench [9] is intended to address the need for technology by providing a single interface to all of the basic functionalities which corpus annotators need, but with enough flexibility that different projects can to provide tlifferent kinds of annotation and that information can be ported between the Workbench and other apitlications.",
        "workbench is a standalone tool written in Java, so it will be able to run without recompilation on many different platforms including l'( s, Macs, and Unix machines."

        "For instance, dialogue might usefully be annotated foriii tt i tie iii al structure-, intonational structure, and syntactic structure, awl, in fact, Ibr the most detailed empirical work, all of these annotations might be needed simultaneonaly so that relationships among them can be explored.",
        "Each type of structure can refer to some sharet1 base level of transcription, whether orthographic or pho netic, with timing information where the speech sip nal is available.",
        "Each type of structure might involve several kinds of tags (for instance, dialogne moves and games, or part-of-speech labelled tokens, phrases, and sentences) but can be considered to broadly hierarchical.",

      "text": [
        "The technological solution to the flexible representation of overlapping tag hierarchies is to use the XML markup language [11].",
        "XML can be used to describe any sort of coding, and the coding structure can be described in a Document Type Definition (DTD) which describes what tags are possible, and where they can occur.",
        "It is not possible for XML tags to overlap within a document, but one can create overlapping hierarchies of markup in the same corpus by using \"hyperlinks\", which serve not just to point to elements in a different hierarchy of markup but also to include them for structural purposes [10].",
        "For example, if dialogue moves are made up of words, and sentences are made up of the same words, as in Figure 1, then both can be linked to the same copy of the words, providing a way of relating the two structures.",
        "An example XML representation of a short dialogue fragment is given in Figure 2.",
        "Of course, XML is designed to be machine-readable, and should rarely (if ever) be inspected directly.",
        "The MATE project will use \"stylesheets\" based on the XSL language [12], which allow one to express operations on an XML corpus which can be used to typeset it for the human reader, choosing both what annotations to make visible and how they should be displayed.",
        "Using MATE stylesheets, it will also be possible to specify the link between user actions and modifications to the XML which is being displayed, and thus implement coding interfaces.",
        "Stylesheets are written as a sequence of rules which match the input and give instructions about what to do for the output.",
        "A simple example of such a rule is:",
        "</result> </msl:template> Line (1) introduces one stylesheet rule.",
        "There will usually be several rules in a stylesheet.",
        "The 'match' attribute tells us which elements this rule will apply to.",
        "In this case, the rule will match <dummy> elements in the input document.",
        "In the MATE stylesheet language, matching is done using the MATE query language; query construction is supported in the workbench by means of a graphical user interface.",
        "Line (2) and following lines gives the template of the rule.",
        "This is a description of the elements which will be created in the output document.",
        "In this case <result> is a literal element, and the result of this rule will be that all <dummy> elements will be converted into <result>A dummy.</result> elements.",
        "Rules in a stylesheet are applied in order of occurrence starting with the top level element in the document.",
        "There is a mechanism for top-down left-to-right traversal of the input document hierarchy, and a default rule for unmatched elements.",
        "Using XML and XSL allows a flexible solution to the problem of technological support, but this solution is not magical.",
        "For instance, XML and XSL do not remove the need to understand how tags relate to each other; they simply make it easier to specify a good machine-readable representation of complex tag relationships and to display these relationships for the human reader.",
        "To see what benefits this technology will bring, it is necessary to analyse the capabilities and requirements of different types of potential workbench users separately."

      "text": [
        "At least for sites involved in large scale coding exercises, data coders are typically the cheapest labour source available.",
        "They do not wish to know anything about how the coding interface works or even how different sets of tags relate to each other.",
        "Their needs are fairly simple: an intuitive coding interface so that they can concentrate on the code distinctions, documentation of how to use the interface – although, human nature being what it is, we find that no amount of written material will replace good verbal instruction – and the coding instructions nearby, preferably on-line.",
        "The MATE Workbench will encourage fulfilment of these needs by providing guidelines and slots for documentation within the coding modules which define the coding task, through the example coding schemes which come with with the workbench, and by providing sufficient coding actions for a wide range of interface designs.",
        "Thus the main benefit to coders is simply a side effect of having good support for the implementation of coding schemes via well-defined coding modules.",
        "Another potential benefit for longer-term coders is the ability to reconfigure the user interface which controls interaction with the workbench components to suit personal preferences, for instance, by rearranging the menus and buttons.",
        "There are several possible types of consumers of existing coded data.",
        "Some users might wish to check the relationships in the data for things which are statistically aberrant, mining the data pre-theoretically for whatever stands out.",
        "Others might wish to export some part of the data in order to train on the relationships which are present in it, in the hopes that some theoretically-motivated relationship will improve performance in, for instance, a spoken dialogue system.",
        "Straight theoreticians might wish to inspect particular relationships in order to test specific research hypotheses.",
        "Whatever the reason for interest in the corpus, consumers are united in their need to ask questions of the corpus, looking for places which match a specific form, and to display the results.",
        "Using the coded data well requires the mathematical capacity to understand the kind of structural information represented graphically in Figure 1, since otherwise the questions which the user asks will be meaningless.",
        "The more theoretically motivated the user, the more important this requirement is.",
        "Of course, this is true for all work with complex tag sets, not just those represented within MATE.",
        "In addition, where new kinds of display are required to match specific explorations of the data, new stylesheets will be required.",
        "The main benefits of the workbench for coding consumers are (a) the possibility of combining many different kinds of annotation on one data source, (b) a well-specified query language for exploring the relationships among the tags, and (c) methods for exporting different cuts on the data to other packages for further theoretical or statistical analysis.",
        "Many people wish to design their own coding schemes, either to improve on the reliability or suitability of an existing scheme or in order to test a particular research question.",
        "These coding developers may hire type 1 coders, but they are quite likely to do their coding themselves.",
        "This group of users has the hardest job.",
        "Designing a complete corpus requires the mathematical capacity not just for understanding structures such as that represented in Figure 1, but also for constructing new ones and mapping these into the sorts of file structures represented in Figure 2.",
        "This is true whether or not the corpus is represented in XML but is sometimes hidden away as something which only the software developer truly understands.",
        "One need not understand the relationships among all the tags on a corpus in order to install a new coding level, but one must at least be able to hook a new tag set into some part of the existing structure.",
        "Although this may seem onerous for the user, in reality most of the requirements are the same as they were before; users who wish to do something new have to understand what it is they are trying to do.",
        "The only additional requirement is that instead of developing their own ad hoc data representations and mappings between the data, the screen, and user actions, users need to understand how data is represented in XML and how to write stylesheets expressing these mappings.",
        "The benefit of XML and XSL for this activity is that they are likely to be better-structured and more flexible than anything coding designers will come up with for themselves, especially if they are not experienced software developers, and that there are many existing tools for support, with more on the way."

        "It is difficult to address all the user types at once, and since so little support currently exists for coding designers, it will be impossible to get the facilities for them right the first time.",

        "The MATE Workbench will be distributed with coding tools and basic display capabilities for a range of coding schemes at various levels of annotation from prosody and morphosyn-tax to dialogue acts and communication problems.",
        "These schemes are being chosen (or, in some cases, developed), based on an extensive review [4].",

        "Display options will include the size ind placement of windows, text colour, font, and size, and text layout such as lists and tables.",
        "The display may include a speech waveform if one is associated with the dialogue, and user actions (such as clicking on an area of text) may be associated with further display information.",

        "However, stylesheets do not enforce the creation of a usable data display.",
        "In particular, it is just as possible to overload a display with too much information using this technique as using any other (and perhaps more tempting, because the stylesheets make this easier to do).",
