        "Currently there are many large linguistic annotated corpora worldwide, but the types of annotation information are limited to morphological and syntactic information.",
        "While there are some corpora annotated with discourse information like speech act types and discourse structures, they are much smaller than that of the corpora with morphological and syntactic information.",
        "One of the major reasons for this difference in the size is due to the lack of computer tools such as morphological analyzers and syntactic parsers to semi-automatically annotate information.",
        "Of course we will be able to develop such tools for discourse information, but before that, we must create a base corpora by setting standards 1 for resource sharing, which can contribute to creating large resources for discourse.",

        "This paper summarized our efforts on standardizing discourse annotation schemes for Japanese and evaluated the reliability of the schemes.",
        "To improve the base reliability of the schemes, (1) interactional units are useful for constraining tag candidates and linking the utterance to the discourse structure level, and (2) discourse markers identified by their surface form can be used as a cue for indicating discourse boundaries.",
        "The reliability issues involve various factors.",
        "For example, in the projects which attain high agreement rate of tagging such as the MapTask and Switchboard, they used syntactic cues in the coding manuals.",
        "This apparently contribute to the high agreement rate of tagging, although there leave some possibilities for confusing syntactic information with the meaning of the tags.",
        "In addition, in the MapTask, they include domain specific knowledge in the tags.",
        "The Switchboard project took the approach that the coders are allowed to tag utterances freely and then create the abstract classification relating to DAMSL coding schemes based on the first tagging experiment.",
        "Interestingly, the coders in the above two projects are all students, not researchers as in DRI and our project.",
        "The student coders are well-trained, while researchers of DRI and our project sometime have some biases to the coding schemes and often take little time for tagging experiments.",
        "The MapTask used the decision tree approach and was successful for attaining the high agreement rate.",
        "Since then, the decision tree approach has been believed to be a key to the high agreement rate.",
        "DRI and our project also adopted this approach, but the resultant agreement rate is not so high, comparing to the MapTask project.",
        "Considering various factoring involving the reliability, we should realise the decision tree approach cannot be a only key to the successful coding schemes.",
        "In this respect, our experiments are interesting.",
        "That is, we showed there is some room for improving coding schemes by introducing different dimensions to the original coding schemes.",
        "This kind of continuous efforts to improving coding schemes should not be looked over.",
        "The computer tagging tools are necessary at least for creating consistent underlying representation of the tagging results.",
        "Moreover, for multilevel tagging, as in MATE and our project, the tools should provide easy access to different level.",
        "In both respects, the MATE tagging tool currently developed will be a very valuable resource for discourse (tagging) research community.",
        "However, if we want to create a large discursive annotated corpora, we must consider to build semi-automatically tagging tools used in morphological and syntactic tagging, which should include some kind of machine learning techniques."
