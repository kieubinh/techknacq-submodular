        "One of the goals of the Eu-funded MATE project is to develop tools to support some of the most popular dialogue coding activities, including annotation of syntactic information, information about `corefer-ence,' and information about dialogue acts.1 A problem to be confronted when trying to develop such tools is the lack of universally agreed upon coding schemes for these 'levels'2 – i.e., of specifications of a set of elements and attributes that will cover all of the information about that level that a researcher may wish to annotate, together with instructions for how to do so.",
        "What does exist at the moment is coding schemes for particular domains and/or applications: in the case of dialogue acts, for example, there are several 'specific' schemes for given applications, some of which have been shown to lead to reliable coding (Alexandersson et al., 1997; Carletta et al., 1997).",
        "Recently, attempts to come up with standards for a few of these levels have been made at workshops organized by the Discourse Resource Initiative (DR1).",
        "The DRI did come up with a proposal concerning the dialogue act level (Discourse Resource Initiative, 1997; Allen and Core, 1997), although there have been serious disagreements concerning the usefulness of such a 'standard' for this level, since it's not clear that it's possible to come up with a domain-independent definition of dialogue acts.",
        "No official recommendation has been made in the DRI for the so-called `coreference' level, although the DRAMA scheme (Passonneau, 1997) has sometimes been discussed for this purpose.",

        "The difficulties to be addressed in the case of the 'coreference' level are of a different nature from those that arise in the case of the other annotation task at the semantic level considered in MATE, the dialogue acts level.",
        "A very basic problem arising in the case of coreference is deciding what type of information is being annotated, since the term `coreference' is used to indicate different things.",
        "The name `coreference' derives from the task of `coreference resolution', one of the semantic interpretation tasks adopted in the Message Understanding Conference (muc), a US initiative to evaluate systems performing information extraction.",
        "The coreference annotation scheme used in MuC-7, mUCCS (Hirschman, 1997) was devised to evaluate the ability of the systems participating in the competition to identify which elements in the text referred to the same object; hence the term `coreference'.",
        "The scheme adopted for annotating references to landmarks in the MapTask corpus is also meant to annotate reference in this sense.",
        "Both the DRAMA scheme and the schemes proposed by Lancaster University (Fligelstone, 1992), instead, are meant to be used to annotate anaphoric information in texts; but coreference is not tile same as anaphoricity.",
        "Two NPs can corefer without either of them being `anaphoric' in the traditional sense – e.g., proper names are not generally considered 'anaphoric expressions', yet two proper names can obviously corefer, as in (la); and conversely, two NPs can be in an anaphoric relation without either of them 'referring' to anything, as in (lb), where one of the engines at Elmira doesn't really refer to any specific engine yet serves as antecedent of that.",
        "(See",
        "(van Deemter and Kibble.",
        "1999) for further discussion.)",
        "Fortunately for our purposes, coreference information can be expressed using the relations used to express anaphoric information, which makes it possible to develop schemes in which both types of information can be encoded, as we will see below.",
        "We will keep referring to the markup level with which we are concerned as `coreference' for consistency with common use, but the reader should use the term with care.",

        "One advantage of the coreference level is that notwithstanding the possible source of confusion just mentioned, there is much more agreement on the underlying catalogue of semantic notions needed to characterize this type of information than there is, say, for the discourse act level, so that it's possible to come up with fairly precise definitions of most of the information one would want to annotate.",
        "So, the main problem the designer of such a scheme has to confront is the sheer pervasiveness of the phenomenon: almost every word in a coherent text-including quantifiers, nouns, (modal) verbs, and adjectives-can be said to be anaphorically related in some way to what has already been introduced in the text, as shown by the following examples.",
        "This means that, in practice, it will always be necessary to restrict somehow the amount of anaphoric information to annotate.",

        "A second problem is that we do not know yet what can be annotated reliably and what cannot.",
        "In their reliability study, (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) found a fair agreement among annotators (K = .76) concerning which NPs were anaphoric and which ones were not, and about 95% agreement on antecedents for those definite descriptions that all subjects identified as anaphoric; but no agreement on identifying bridging references (K=.24), and often different antecedents were indicated for those that all annotators classified as bridges.3 As a result, the only coding scheme whose reliability has been extensively tested is muccs."

        "These considerations suggested a 'meta-scheme' approach to the goal of developing a scheme for the coreference level that could be useful for different types of applications.",
        "What this means is that instead of proposing a single scheme, we identified a range of possible types of information about `coreference' one may want to annotate, on the basis of the coding schemes for coreference discussed above; we evaluated how reliable each type of annotation is likely to be; and we specified the markup language needed to pursue each option.",

        "As the poor reliability scores which have been obtained by (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) for this kind of scheme indicate, once one moves beyond the ident relation, it can be difficult to decide how to classify the link between two elements.",
        "We tried to alleviate this problem by adopting the TEI technique of specifying 'subtypes' of links: in those cases in which it may be difficult to identify precisely the type of relation that exists between two entities, we introduced a more general relation to be used as type of a link, as well as more specific relations to be used as values of the SUBTYPE attribute in those cases in which this additional specification is possible.",
        "We used this technique for two types of relations: possession relations (which include generic attribution, true possession and part as subtypes) and event relations (which include relations such as cause and 'role' as subparts).",
        "The following example illustrates how type and subtype attributes can be used to encode possession relations at the desired level of precision, as well as why sometimes it may be difficult to decide which relation holds between two discourse entities.",
        "The basic problem to be solved when trying to do this type of annotation is to come up with instructions that will ensure that annotators recognize bridging references.",
        "As a preliminary proposal, we suggest that annotators try first to identify an antecedent which is identical with the anaphor; if that fails, they should try first to find a discourse entity with which the anaphor stands in one of the set relations, then one with which it stands in one of the generalized possession relations.",
