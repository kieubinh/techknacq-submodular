        "Recent years have witnessed a growing concern with the provision of standardized formats for exchange, integration and use of shareable annotated dialogues, and the resulting development of formal frameworks intended to compare, standardize and customize annotation schemes for dialogue acts (see (Allen and Core, 1997; Core and Allen, 1997; Larsson, 1998; Ichikawa et al., 1998).",
        "Arguably, these efforts should be instrumental in speeding up progress in the field, meeting at the same time the rapidly increasing demands of dialogue system technology.",
        "It is important to observe that any framework of this kind should be able to explicitly characterize both scope and nature of the dialogue phenomena covered by a given tag set, since they appear to vary considerably from scheme to scheme, as a function of i) the analytical standpoints adopted and ii) the dimensions of linguistic and contextual analysis taken into account.",
        "We hereafter introduce some key – ideas (namely, recognition – based vs generation – based annotation and annotation meta – scheme) that have, in our view of things, the potential of making explicit in a principled and declarative way the relationship between tag definitions and underlying dimensions of analysis.",
        "Careful consideration of this relationship makes it possible to conceive of a dialogue tag as a point in an n – dimensional space, rather than as an undecomposable conceptual unit.",
        "As we will see, this offers a number of advantages over other existing approaches to scheme comparison and standardization.'"

        "It is useful to recognize two complementary approaches to labeling utterances with dialogue acts, hereafter referred to for convenience as a generation-based and a recognition-based perspective.",
        "The generation perspective is chiefly concerned with the question \"given a dialogue utterance, what underlying mental process might have produced it?\".",
        "Such a mental process can be defined i) as a communicative \"intention\", or, alternatively, ii) in terms of a formal characterization of the reasoning process underlying dialogues, with specific emphasis on the effects of speech acts on the agents' mental states (or information states) and, ultimately, on dialogue planning (Poesio and Traum, 1998; Poesio et al., 1999).",
        "The recognition perspective, on the other hand, addresses the question: \"given a dialogue utterance, on the basis of what available linguistic or contextual clues can one recognize its underlying intention(s)?\".",
        "By linguistic and contextual clues, we mean here a variety of more or less overtly available information, ranging from the surface linguistic realization of an utterance, to its propositional content and the pragmatic context where the dialogue is situated.",
        "A generation-based approach lays emphasis on the (assumed) accessibility of the mental states/intentions of a speaker in a dialogue, either through an explicit representation of these states (as feature – based informational structures), or through a step of abductive inference on the annotator's part.",
        "In the recognition – based approach, attention is shifted to the interpretability of an utterance as conveying a certain intention, where interpretability is a function of the information available to the hearer/annotator at a certain point in time.",
        "Ideally, the two perspectives should lead to the same annotated dialogue.",
        "In practice, this is often not the case, due to the wide range of variation in the information accessible to the hearer/annotator.",
        "In a generation – based approach, an utterance can simultaneously be intended to respond, promise, request, inform etc.",
        "A recognition – based perspective makes use of a different notion of multifunctionality whereby several intentions can be recognized on the basis of distinct dimensions of linguistic and extra – linguistic information.",
        "For example, an utterance like I want to go to Boston can be i) a claim, if judged on its linguistic declarative form only, ii) an answer, relative to a previously uttered request, and iii) an order, if - say - addressed to a taxi – driver.",
        "In this perspective, it is relatively immaterial whether, e.g., the utterance was ultimately and primarily intended as an assert; rather, it is sufficient to observe that one could interpret I want to go to Boston as an assert, on the basis of a certain type of available linguistic or contextual information.",
        "It is important to emphasize at this stage that virtually no existing annotation scheme for dialogue acts can be said to instantiate either perspective only.",
        "In fact, the vast majority of tag sets exhibit, to different degrees, a combination of the two approaches.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we will elaborate the recognition – based perspective as a basis for annotation scheme comparability, standardization and customization."

      "text": [
        "We call an annotation meta – scheme a formal framework for comparing annotation schemes, which can also be used as a practical blue – print to scheme design and customization.",
        "A crucial feature of the annotation meta – scheme illustrated here is that it is intended to make explicit the type of linguistic and contextual information relied upon in the process of tagging dialogue utterances with illocutionary acts.",
        "In this respect, the meta – scheme is chiefly recognition – based.",
        "In practice, this is achieved by defining one independent taxonomy of utterance tags for each of the orthogonal dimensions of linguistic or contextual analysis which have a bearing on the definition of dialogue acts.",
        "For example, in some cases dialogue acts are identified on the basis of the linguistic form of an utterance only.",
        "We thus find it convenient to define an autonomous typology of tags based on purely grammatical facts such as, e.g., subject – auxiliary inversion, tvh – words, a rise of intonation etc.",
        "Surely, tags defined along this dimension will often fail to convey the primary intention of a given utterance: for example, an interrogative sentence may conceal an order, and an explicit performative may turn an assert into a request.",
        "Yet this should not worry us, as long as the relation between a tag and its supporting dimension of analysis is explicitly stated.",
        "It should be appreciated that, in existing annotation schemes, the relationship between linguistic and contextual clues on the one hand and tag definitions on the other hand is characterized only implicitly.",
        "Linguistic and contextual dimensions of analysis are simultaneously drawn upon in tag definitions in a complex way, so that the relationship of these dimensions with each tag is often only indirect.",
        "This will be illustrated in more detail in the following sections.",
        "Suffice it to point out here that, far from being a methodological flaw, this practice responds to the practical need of annotating utterances in a maximally economic way, i.e. with the sparsest possible set of tags.",
        "Clearly, requirements of economy and ease of annotation are appropriate for labeling a dialogue text with a specific application or a specific theoretical framework in mind.",
        "However, they may get in the way when it comes to comparing different annotation schemes, or exporting the annotation scheme developed for a given application to another domain.",
        "In these latter cases, perspicuity of the linguistic and contextual content of tags should be given priority over other more practical concerns."

      "text": [
        "In this section we will sketchily overview two of the most important attempts at providing standardized dialogue – act tags for general annotation, namely DAMSL (Allen and Core, 1997; Core and Allen, 1997) and Larsson's (Larsson, 1998), with particular emphasis on the assumptions underlying their methodological approach.",
        "DAMSL is certainly the most influential effort in the provision of standards for dialogue annotation to date (Allen and Core, 1997; Core and Allen, 1997).",
        "It is designed to offer a general, underspecified scheme, potentially usable in different domains, and susceptible of further specification into finer grained domain – specific categories.",
        "DAMSL is credited for taking the issue of utterance multifunctionality most seriously: an utterance can be tagged at the same time along several orthogonal dimensions of annotation, each of them defining an independent layer of communicative intention.",
        "Accordingly, the same utterance can be interpreted, e.g., as giving information, making a request, making a promise etc.",
        "It is important to emphasize here that, in DAMSL, multiple dimensions serve the purpose of capturing different facets of an illocutionary act and are not intended to directly reflect the different linguistic and contextual dimensions on the basis of which these facets are recognized.",
        "In this sense, DAMSL multidimensionality is predominantly generation – based.",
        "Nonetheless, tag definitions are a mixed bag of generation and recognition – based criteria.",
        "At the core of the DAMSL taxonomy lies a bipartition between the so – called forward – and backward – looking dialogue functions, a fairly faithful rendering of Searlian speech act categories (Searle, 1969).",
        "The assumed orthogonality of all dimensions makes virtually any combination of DAMSL dimensions admissible for annotation, in a potentially combinatorial explosion of multiple tags.",
        "Finally, although originally conceived as a meta-scheme, DAMSL has been used and circulated since its conception as yet another independent scheme in its own right, often proving too general to be of practical use.",
        "More importantly, the fact that it provides non-exclusive categories seems to have a negative impact on its reliability (Core and Allen, 1997).",
        "A different approach to standardization is taken in Larsson (Larsson, 1998), who suggests to model the comparison of two different encoding schemes as a mapping function between the two corresponding hierarchies of tags (taxonomies).",
        "The correspondence induced by the mapping function can be one-to-one, one-to-many and one-to-none.",
        "Two tags which are in a one-to-one relationship are taken to be synonymous.",
        "A one-to-many relationship is interpreted as suggesting that one tag in a taxonomy subsumes more than one tag in another taxonomy, as illustrated in figure 1 for the relationship between Info-request in DAMSL and the tags Check, Align, Query-yn and Query-w in the HCRC MAP TASK annotation scheme (Carletta et al., 1996).",
        "One-to-many mappings (and many-to-one) hold between those branches in two taxonomies which are specified at different levels of granularity.",
        "Finally, a one-to-none correspondence signifies that a particular taxonomy is silent on a range of phenomena which happen to be overtly marked in another taxonomy.",
        "For instance, since MAP TASK provides no tag for the category of commissives, this phenomenon is understood to be covered by tags provided in DAMSL only.",
        "Eventually, a more general and comprehensive hierarchy subsuming the two compared schemes is built by a) taking the intersection set of synonymous tags, b) taking one-to-none tags from either taxonomy only, c) representing a one-to-many tag relationship as a mother-daughters hierarchy of the corresponding nodes.",
        "For reasons that will be made clear in the following section, this approach ends up considerably redefining scope and applicability of the tags considered.",
        "For example, when a Reply-y of MAP TASK is classified as a daughter node of DAMSL Answer, one is in fact ignoring that, in MAP TASK, Reply-y has a rather broader scope than the one entailed by this correspondence.",
        "To sum up, the standardization efforts reviewed in this section are not concerned with drawing a principled line between a generation-based and a recognition-based perspective.",
        "As a result, tags of different schemes are typically related to one another through functional synonymy, subsumption or generation-based multifunctionality.",
        "As we will see in the following section, this may in some cases oh",

        "As already pointed out above, Larsson's approach to developing more comprehensive tag hierarchies by mapping comparable tag sets logically presupposes three types of correspondence being at work: one-to-one, one-to-many and one-to-none.",
        "This is pictorially illustrated in figure 1, which summarizes Larsson's (Larsson, 1998) mapping function between DAMSL and MAP TASK, in the area of asserts and requests.",
        "However, the assumption that different tag sets tend to partition the same range of phenomena at different levels of granularity, in much the same way two taxonomies may mutually differ at the level of depth at which (some of) their branches are specified, is unwarranted.",
        "In fact, different annotation schemes take different analytical perspectives on dialogue phenomena, and end up with carving them up into different categories.",
        "This situation typically produces many-to-many tag correspondences.",
        "In a pilot experiment, we used four different dialogue-act schemes2 to annotate a small corpus of five English task-oriented dialogues.3 All dialogues were manually tagged by two different annotators with all annotation schemes.",

        "Table 1 illustrates this point, showing the actual correspondences between DAMSL and MAP TASK, in the common area of asserts and requests.",
        "For each slot of table 1 at the crossing of DAMSL tag hi and MAP TASK tag tm, we report the averaged number of times an utterance labeled as tp is also assigned tm, divided by the total number of utterances tagged as tp.",
        "These figures show two things.",
        "First, Larsson's mappings reflect prevalent patterns of tag correspondence only partially.",
        "Secondly, such patterns are far from being exhaustive of the range of possible use of the tags involved.",
        "To give but one example, out of 10 utterances tagged as MAP TASK Explain in one of our test dialogues, 9 are tagged as DAMSL Assert, 6 as DAMSL Offer, and 3 as DAMSL Open-option.",
        "We conclude that Larsson's approach is useful to uncover degrees of correspondence between tag sets, but is still too shallow to shed light on the nature of this correspondence.",

        "Both schemes are mono – dimensional, meaning that they assign only one tag per utterance.",
        "Yet, this does not seem to simplify their pattern of correspondence, which turns out to be, once more, many – tomany, as illustrated in table 2.",
        "Consider, for example, the relationship between MAP TASK Reply-y and VERBMOBIL Accept and Feedback-positive.",
        "Reply-y is almost exclusively concerned with the linguistic form of an utterance, while VERBMOBIL Accept and Feedback-positive are mainly based on the relationship between a reply and the propositional content of the utterance being replied to.",

        "To limit ourselves to some of the tags in table 2, such dimensions range from syntax (Reply-y) to propositional content (Feedback-positive) and co – text (Accept).",
        "Many – to – many mapping can thus be viewed as the result of the following situation: i) for each tag set, tags are defined in relation to their relevance to an intended goal (be it practical or theoretical); ii) the definition calls upon a number of relatively independent classificatory dimensions; iii) neither all tags in the same tag set nor tags belonging to different schemes consistently share the same dimensions.",

        "First, tags are largely underspecified.",
        "Moreover, the focus of annotation is shifted here from the identification of primary illocutionary acts to the recognizable linguistic and contextual clues for their identification.",
        "We will return to this important point in the following section.",
        "Table 5 exemplifies the annotation of a dialogue excerpt (two turns, three utterances) with the categories in the theta-scheme.",
        "Table 6 reports the degree of multidimensional similarity between MAP TASK Explain, on the one hand, and DAMSL Assert, Re-Assert, Open-Option, Offer and Info-Request on the other hand.",
        "In the table, each tag is represented as a point in the n-dimensional space staked out by the meta-scheme.",
        "The first column gives the invariant meta-scheme tags which are shared by all utterances tagged as Explain.",
        "A dash (`-') in the column signifies that tags vary along the corresponding dimension: this means that the dimension is not criterial for the definition of Explain.",
        "This is the case of D2.2 (polarity), D3.2 (compliance) and D4.1 (pragmatic illocutionary force).",
        "In the remaining columns, we put `-=' to signify dimensional equivalence, i.e. identity of invariant meta-scheme tags, and `0' to express diversity.",
        "Once more, a dash is used to indicate that the corresponding dimension is orthogonal to the information conveyed by the tag.",
        "Intuitively, the tags more similar to Explain are those with more and fewer `0' in the corresponding column.",
        "Note that Assert turns out to be the tag with the highest number of matching dimensions (`='), and the lowest number of mismatches (`0').",
        "This explains why MAP TASK Explain is the most natural candidate for replacing DAMSL Assert, as suggested by Larsson.",
        "We can now give reasons for that: Assert differs from Explain in that the former, unlike the latter, conveys no stable initiative force.",
        "Note further, however, that Explain is not defined along dimension D4.1, which, in turn, defines tags such as Open-option, Offer and Info-Request.",
        "This suggests that Explain is also likely to replace these tags when they are assigned to assertive and truth conditional",
        "utterances, that is when these utterances happen to meet the criteria for identification of Explain.",
        "Incidentally, it should be noted that the evidence of table 6 provides a justification of the figures reported in table 1, which would otherwise remain counterintuitive in the light of tag definitions."

        "It is useful, at this stage, to elaborate this point.",
        "First, multidimensionality and orthogonality of the assumed multiple dimensions seem to be operationally cumbersome and, in general, detract from reliability in actual tagging practice.",
        "Furthermore, in the meta – scheme all classificatory dimensions are conceived of as being on a par.",
        "This means that we deliberately make no assumption as to what dimension of annotation ultimately provides information about the primary intended illocutionary act of an utterance, and how information along one dimension relates to information encoded at another dimension.",
        "This is not very informative from the point of view of annotation, but represents a very useful feature for scheme customization, as it makes it possible to modify/adapt an existing annotation scheme by collapsing some analytical dimensions in a controlled way.",
        "Finally, it should be appreciated that the list of dimensions provided here is not meant to be either exhaustive or minimal, in the sense that every tag should be classified along each dimension.",
        "Other possible dimensions of analysis can include, for example, kinesic information, to account for dialogue acts performed through non-verbal communicative behavior, such as nodding, smiling and pointing.",

        "Tag sets are typically developed to respond to specific applications and practical usages, without bothering too much about how the tags themselves relate to the nature of information needed for their assignment in context.",
        "This is fine as long as tag sets are assessed in relation to the use they were originally intended for, but much less so if one wants to evaluate the extent to which one tag set translates into another tag set, or to assess the usability of a given tag set for other purposes/applications.",
        "The multi – dimensional recognition – based meta – scheme described in these pages makes it explicit how intentions relate to the linguistic and contextual information needed for their identification.",
        "We showed that this is extremely helpful for scheme comparison, as it sheds light on the precise nature of tag correspondences, well beyond the intuitive grasp provided by tag definitions.",
        "Preliminary experiments show that a translation of a dialogue tagged with an existing scheme into our meta – scheme is also a useful exercise to assess the internal consistency of the annotated material.",
        "If this is confirmed, then use of the meta – scheme should improve scheme design considerably, and should be able to provide procedural and testable guide – lines for dialogue annotators."
