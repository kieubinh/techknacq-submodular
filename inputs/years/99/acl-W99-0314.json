        "The annotation scheme (AC97) developed by the Discourse Research Initiative's Backward and Forward-Looking Group (henceforth referred to as the BF scheme) provides a set of tags that can be applied to individual utterances in a dialogue, describing the utterance's illocutionary force.",
        "The BF scheme provides a standard top-level tag set that allows researchers to reuse corpora that have been annotated for other projects, and also allows tags to be refined by individual projects to provide detail on particular phenomena being studied.",
        "There are a number of dialogue features that are of interest to researchers, and for which tagging schemes have been developed.",
        "One feature that we are concerned with is grounding, the mechanism by which dialogue participants augment their mutual beliefs.",
        "In his dissertation work (Tra94), Traum establishes a set of tags to describe grounding behavior, and then uses this taxonomy of grounding acts to describe a computational model of how dialogue participants achieve a state of mutual understanding.",
        "Traum's model describes how grounding acts can be combined to form discourse units, segments of a dialogue that correspond to individual contributions to the common ground.",
        "Clark and Schaefer define a contribution as the presentation of a proposition by one dialogue participant, as well as all subsequent related utterances until there is adequate evidence that the initial utterance was understood or abandoned (CS89).",
        "Discourse units are the level of granularity at which other dialogue tags, such as the problem-solving acts described in (SA97), are applied.",
        "Annotating dialogues can be a time-consuming and error-prone undertaking.",
        "To make the annotation process easier and more reliable, care should be taken to avoid manually tagging information that can be derived from other tags or that can be automatically extracted.",
        "This paper explores how we can automatically annotate dialogues with grounding tags, given a corpus that has been annotated with the BF tags.",
        "Once grounding has been marked, we can automatically segment the dialogue into discourse units, using Traum's model.",
        "In order to tag with BF tags or grounding tags, a dialog must be segmented into utterances, a problem that is discussed briefly in section 2.",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of the BF tags and grounding tags, section 4 discusses the mapping from BF tags to grounding tags, and section 5 presents a comparison of the automatic mapping to a human annotator."

        "Traum uses a special grounding tag, CONTINUE, when a prosodically-segmented utterance is not an independent grounding act, but rather part of the same grounding act as a previous utterance by the same speaker.",
        "Another possible approach to utterance segmentation for BF tagging is to allow the annotator to segment the dialogue and label it for BF tags at the same time.",
        "The problem with this approach is that different annotators may segment the same dialogue differently, making it difficult to compare annotations.",
        "One way of dealing with this problem is to have subsequent annotators use the first annotator's segmentation.",
        "A drawback of this solution is that the first annotator's segmentation may influence subsequent BF labeling.",
