        "In this paper, we discuss the design of a database of recorded and transcribed read and spontaneous speech of semi-fluent, strongly-accented non-native speakers of English.",
        "While many speech applications work best with a recognizer that expects native-like usage, others could benefit from a speech recognition component that is forgiving of the sorts of errors that are not a barrier to communication; in order to train such a recognizer a database of non-native speech is needed.",
        "We examine how collecting data from non-native speakers must necessarily differ from collection from native speakers, and describe work we did to develop an appropriate scenario, recording setup, and optimal surroundings during recording."

      "text": [
        "As part of work in improving speech recognition performance for non-native speakers, we wanted to develop a database that captures ways in which non-native language use differs from native language use in a specific domain.",
        "Features we were interested in include pronunciation, lexical choice, syntax, expressive goals, and strategies speakers use when they are unsure of the appropriate English expression.",
        "We wanted the recorded data to be appropriate for LVCSR system training, which means that the signal quality should be good and the speech should be as close as possible in terms of style and content to speech that will be used in the target application, a tourist information query system.",
        "We also wanted to elicit data which would contain examples of systematic and unsystematic variation in the speech of low to mid-fluency non-native speakers.",
        "One of the most interesting aspects of these experiments was the ways in which we found ourselves needing to adapt our usual data collection strategies to the needs of our speakers, whose English abilities varied from beginning to near-native.",
        "It is important to be aware of a number of assumptions that are commonly made which do not necessarily hold for nonnative speakers, and which it is important to address when designing a data collection protocol.",
        "The act of speaking is not difficult.",
        "When recording native speakers speaking spontaneously for standard LVCSR projects (that is, not projects geared towards special populations or difficult tasks), it is assumed that the the act of speaking does not in and of itself represent a major cognitive load for the speaker.",
        "This can be very untrue of non-native speakers, and we had several speakers ask to quit in the middle of the recording because they felt unable to continue.",
        "The researcher needs to make a decision about what to do in such a situation, and possibly prepare an alternate task.",
        "There is little risk of alienating the community.",
        "Local communities of non-native speakers are not always large, and if it is close knit, word can quickly spread if the task is too hard or embarassing.",
        "Also, it is important to deemphasize the fact that we are interested, among other things, in imperfections in the speaker's speech, or risk offending the community.",
        "The task is not perceived as a test.",
        "Again, when speaking spontaneously, few native speakers of nonstigmatized varieties of English would feel that they are being evaluated on the correctness of their speech.",
        "Many non-native speakers will feel tested, and as this can make them nervous and affect their speech, it is important to reassure them as far as possible that",
        "they are not being tested and that the data is being anonymized.",
        "The speaker knows what to say.",
        "Most spontaneous collection tasks are chosen because they are tasks speakers can be expected to have done before and be comfortable with.",
        "Although a non-native speaker has probably made an airplane reservation in his native language before, it is entirely possible that he has never done so in the target language, and does not have a good idea of what he should say in that situation.",
        "If he were really planning to make an airplane reservation in the target language, he would probably think about what to say in advance and might even ask someone, which he may not have a chance to do during the data collection.",
        "This undermines the representativeness of the database.",
        "We carried out a number of exploratory experiments to try to determine the format which was the most comfortable for the speakers and which resulted in elicitation of the most natural data; two of these experiments are described in Section 3.",
        "For these experiments we worked with native speakers of Japanese.",
        "The protocol that we settled on, which we feel is very effective for non-native speakers, is described in Section 4.",
        "Although transcription and analysis of this data is at the beginning stages, we have already seen patterns that will be useful for developing acoustic and language models.",
        "Examples are shown in Section 5."

        "Their productions, however, were more varied, different both from each other and from the original English prompt.",
        "In addition to the prompt-based task, we had speakers read from a local travel guide, specifically about the university area so that the context would be somewhat familiar.",
        "We found that there were indeed reading errors of the type that would not occur in spontanous speech.",
        "We observed that some speakers were stumbling over words that they obviously didn't know.",

        "Our speakers were native speakers of Japanese, however, which has a different writing system; this would have some influence.",

        "In the second pilot experiment, we attempted a wizard-of-oz collection using an interactive map; the speakers could ask for locations and routes to be highlighted in the map, and there was a text screen to which the wizard could send messages to answer speaker queries.",
        "Instead of a list of prompts, the speakers were given a sheet of paper listing some points of interest in the city, hotel names, some features that they could ask about (business hours, location, etc.)",

        "Our general impression was that although the visual highlighting of the locations was a feature that the users enjoyed, and which helped them to become involved in the task, the utterances could not be characterized as more natural than those given in the prompted task.",
        "It was also our feeling that speakers were less sure of what to do in a less structured task; both lack of confidence in speaking and unfamiliarity with a \"just say whatever comes to mind\" approach contributed to their general discomfort.",

        "Although we thought that the repair dialogues that came about when the wizard misunderstood the speaker were valuable data, and that someone trained to provide responses geared toward the fluency level of the speaker would have more success as a wizard, it was our opinion that given the range of fluency levels we were targeting, wizard-of-oz collection would not be ideal for the following two reasons:",
        "• communication and speaker confidence break down when the speaker is really having trouble expressing himself and the wizard cannot understand • simulating a real-life experience, such as making a hotel reservation, without the real goal of wanting to stay in a hotel and background knowledge about the trip, can be very difficult depending on language ability and cultural background"

        "Given that our speakers are even more restricted in their phrasings than native speakers are in conversational speech, it is likely that some phonetic contexts are extremely sparsely represented in our data.",
        "However, it may be the case that semi-fluent speakers avoid some constructions precisely because they are difficult to pronounce, and a sparsity in the training data probably is a good predictor of a sparsity in unseen data; even with new words, which may have as-yet-unseen phonetic contexts, non-native speakers may not pronounce them at all in the way that the designer of the phonetically balanced text had anticipated.",
        "We chose a 1000-word version of the fairy tale Snow White for our read texts; it had the highest syllable growth rate of any of the fairy tales we looked at and we augmented the syllable inventory by replacing some words with others, trying to ensure at the same time that all of the words were ones our speakers were likely to have encountered before.",
        "Finally, we ask speakers to read a selection of previously recorded and transcribed utterances from the prompted task, both by native speakers and non-native speakers, randomly selected and with small modifications made to preserve anonymity.",
        "Our objective here was threefold: to quantify the difference between read dialogues and spontaneous dialogues; to quantify the difference between read dialogues and read prose; and to compare the performance of the end recognizer on native grammar with non-native pronunciation with performance on non-native grammar with non-native pronunciation.",
