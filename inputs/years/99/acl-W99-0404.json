        "While at present speech performances on the COPI are evaluated by trained raters using a national standard, the COPI affords an excellent opportunity to investigate the use of Natural Language Processing for computer-assisted evaluation."

        "Computers allowed for the development of computer-adaptive and computer-administered tests in second languages.",
        "Since June of 1998, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) has administered the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) by computer in many parts of the world.",
        "With almost one million test takers a year, the TOEFL is the world's largest language test.",
        "The use of computer technology has allowed ETS to introduce a new variety of selected-response type items not easily presented in paper and pencil format.",

        "regarded as performance-based, since examinees provide a demonstration of their linguistic abilities through producing a text.",
        "While some have argued that multiple-choice tests of listening comprehension can provide a proxy measure of speaking ability, speaking skills have traditionally been assessed through some type of performance-based assessment, typically a live face-to-face oral interview procedure.",
        "The best known formal procedure is the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI).",
        "The OPI is used by various government agencies involved with language training, including the Foreign Service Institute, where it was originally developed in the 1950s to assess the readiness of US personnel for functioning in oversees diplomatic posts.",
        "In US academia, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) has promulgated the OPI since the early 1980s through professional development workshops and tester training programs (Stansfield, 1996).",
        "In the mid-1980s, the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL) began a program of research and development in using technology to elicit speech samples from examinees that can be assessed following the same criteria used in the AC1FL OPT.",
        "The impetus for this program was the need to assess speaking skills of students of less-commonly-taught-languages in instructional programs throughout the nation where there was no trained OPT interviewer.",
        "Performances elicited by and recorded on tape could then be sent to trained OH testers for evaluation.",
        "The format developed by CAL came to be known as the Simulated Oral Proficiency Interview (SOP!).",
        "High correlations (averaging .92) were found between performances on the SOPI and the OPI across a variety of languages (Stansfield and Kenyon, 1992).",
        "The testing format was also found to be useful in large-scale testing applications where it was necessary to ensure that all examinees received the same high quality test, and the SOPI format has been used in or adapted for a variety of language testing projects.",

        "Tape-mediated speaking tests existed prior to the development of the SOPI.",
        "One example is the original version of the Test of Spoken English (TSE), developed by ETS and used to assess the oral language skills (particularly comprehensibility) of foreign teaching assistants.",
        "There are now many tape-mediated speaking tests or portions of larger tests that assess speaking skills through the use of a tape.",
        "Tests including tape-mediated speaking portions include the Advanced Placement Exams in modern languages and the PRAXIS examination used by states to certify language teachers.",
        "The main difference between these tests and the SOPI and now the COP!, however, is that such tests are assessed using criteria developed specifically for the exam, whereas the SOPI is assessed using the ACTFL Speaking Proficiency Guidelines (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 1986, 1999), which exist outside the context of the assessment.",
        "The ACTFL Guidelines stand in a tradition of oral proficiency testing in the United States that dates to the 1950s, when the then Secretary of State called for the creation of criteria that could be used to identify the foreign language proficiency of U.S. government employees (Stansfield, 1996).",
        "The result was a 0-5 scale, ranging from \"no knowledge\" to \"total mastery,\" with a brief definition of proficiency associated with each point on the scale.",
        "Since their original creation, the definitions have undergone a number of revisions, but are still in use and known today as the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) Skill Level Descriptions.",
        "In the early 1980s, the government's definitions were adapted and disseminated by ACTFL for",
        "use in the nation's secondary schools and colleges.",
        "These definitions have come to be known as the ACTFL Guidelines.",
        "First published in a provisional version in 1982, they were revised and published for large-scale use in 1986 (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 1986).",
        "While the Guidelines cover all four language skills, the Speaking Proficiency Guidelines have been recently revised and republished in 1999 (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages, 1999).",
        "The ACTFL Guidelines define proficiency as \"the ability to use the language effectively and appropriately in real-life situations\" (Buck, Byrnes, and Thompson, 1989, 1.1).",
        "The Guidelines posit four levels of proficiency: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and Superior.",
        "The first three levels are further broken into three sublevels: Low, Mid, and High.",
        "Thus, the Guidelines define 10 levels of proficiency: Novice Low, Novice Mid, Novice High, Intermediate Low, Intermediate Mid, Intermediate High, Advanced Low, Advanced Mid, Advanced High, and Superior.",
        "The Guidelines define proficiency in terms of the global tasks or functions the speaker can handle, the contexts in which he or she can effectively communicate, the content about which the speaker can communicate, and the accuracy with which he or she communicates.",
        "Accuracy is typically considered in terms of how well the speaker is understood by his or her interlocutors.",
        "Thus, unlike other technology-based speaking tests, the overriding goal of the SOPI and the COPI is to use technology to provide a valid surrogate assessment to the face-to-face OPT.",
        "In other words, the performance must be ratable using the criteria of the ACTFL Guidelines and an examinee should be assessed at the same ACTFL proficiency level using any technique.",
        "Because the ACTFL Guidelines have had a major national impact and are so widely used in the US in both academia and government, we feel that this is the best way for our current project to have the greatest national impact."

        "In order to make appropriate assessments, the test must give the rater evidence that examinees assessed at a particular level do not control the features of the next higher level of proficiency.",

        "In order to ensure that examinees are pushed to show the full extent of their ability, the difficulty level of all tasks cannot be examinee-selected.",
        "Raters need to hear examinees attempt tasks higher than their proficiency level to ascertain their consistent level of performance.",
        "By keeping track of the examinee's choices, a program can ensure that this occurs.",

        "Depending on the choices that the examinee makes, the test takes anywhere from 30-50 minutes.",
