        "Computer-mediated language assessment appeals to educators and language evaluators because it has the potential for making language assessment widely available with minimal human effort and limited expense.",
        "Fairly robust results (K P.:, 0.8) have been achieved in the commercial domain modeling the human rater results, with both the Electronic Essay Rater (e-rater) system for written essay scoring (Burstein et al., 1998), and the PhonePass pronunciation assessment (Ordinate, 1998).",
        "There are at least three reasons why it is not possible to model the human rating process.",
        "First, there is a mismatch between what the technology is able to handle and what people manipulate, especially in the assessment of speech features.",
        "Second, we lack a well-articulated model of the human process, often characterized as holistic.",
        "Certain assessment features have been identified, but their relative importance is not clear.",
        "Furthermore, unlike automatic assessments, human raters of oral proficiency exams are trained to focus on competencies, which are difficult to enumerate.",
        "In contrast, automatic assessments of spoken language fluency typically use some type of error counting, comparing duration, silence, speaking rate and pronunciation mismatches with native speaker models.",
        "There is, therefore, a basic tension within the field of computer-mediated language assessment, between modeling the assessment process of human raters or achieving comparable, consistent assessments, perhaps through different means.",
        "Neither extreme is entirely satisfactory.",
        "A spoken assessment system that achieves human-comparable performance based only, for example, on the proportion of silence in an utterance would seem not to be capturing a number of critical elements of language competence, regardless of how accurate the assessments are.",
        "Such a system would also be severely limited in its ability to provide constructive feedback to language learners or teachers.",
        "The e-rater system has received similar criticism for basing essay assessments on a number of largely lexical features, rather than on a deeper, more human-style rating process.",
        "Thirdly, however, even if we could articulate and model human performance, it is not clear that we want to model all aspects of the human rating process.",
        "For example, human performance varies due to fatigue.",
        "Transcribers often inadvertently correct examinees' errors of omitted or incorrect articles, conjugations, or affixes.",
        "These mistakes are a natural effect of a cooperative listener; however, they result in an overoptimistic assessment of the speaker's actual proficiency.",
        "We arguably do not wish to build this sort of cooperation into an automated",
        "assessment system, though it is likely desirable for other sorts of human-computer interaction systems.",
        "Furthermore, if we focus on modeling human processes we may end up underutilizing the technology.",
        "Balancing human-derived features with machine learning techniques may actually allow us to discuss more about the human rating process by making the entire process available for inspection and evaluation.",
        "For example, if we are able to articulate human rating features, machine learning techniques may allow us to 'learn' the relative weighting of these features for a particular assessment value."

        "In the domain of acoustic features and speech recognition, we suggest the technology currently does not permit complete modeling of the rating process.",
        "Nevertheless, the paucity of data in our domain requires us to adopt the transfer model of speech, which permits automatic adaptation to errorful speech.",
        "In addition, our recognizer incorporates a relaxed grammar, permitting input to vary from the target language at the lexical and syntactic levels.",
        "These adaptations allow us to model human perception and processing of (non-native) speech, as required by our task.",
        "In the non-acoustic domain, we also adopt machine learning techniques to pool the relevant human-identified features.",
        "As a result, we can learn more about the feature-weighting in the process of tuning to an appropriate level of reliability with the results of human raters."
