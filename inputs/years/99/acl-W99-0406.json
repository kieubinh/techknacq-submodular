        "For our MT system users who are also language learners, we are developing a suite of linguistic tools that enable them, on the same laptop platform, to perform their foreign language filtering tasks using a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Machine Translation (MT), Information Retrieval (IR) and language sustainment tools.2 Thus we have begun constructing linguistic test suites that can serve the dual needs we have for the evaluation of MT systems and language learning.3 In this paper, we present our pilot work (i) defining and constructing a semantic domain of spatial expressions as a test suite, (ii) testing our MT system on the 'The term embedded MT system, adopted from Voss and Reeder (1998), refers to a computer system with several software components, including an MT engine.",
        "2 We are creating a single interface for the MT system and the language sustainment tools that enables users to guide their own learning during MT-aided tasks, such as filtering, in contrast to single-purpose tutoring systems (e.g., Holland et al., 1995) 3 For others addressing multiple uses of linguistic resources, see NLP-IA (1998).",

        "As noted by Jackendoff (1983), English locational (or Place-type) prepositions may be ambiguous because they may also have a directional (or Path-type) reading.6 For example, sentence 2 below, is ambiguous in English.",
        "In the 2a reading, the bottle moves along a path as it floats, starting away from the bridge and ending up under the bridge.",
        "In the 2b reading, the bottle remains under the bridge as it floats: no path is specified, only the general location where the floating took place.",

        "We selected the domain of spatial expressions for evaluation in part because, as example 3 shows, the ambiguity of English spatial prepositions may significantly interfere with the task of accurate message understanding – whether by MT systems or second language learners.",

        "Such measures of effectiveness are difficult to obtain, and researchers, outside of the field, must rely instead on linguistically based measures of performance.",
        "Thus, our approach has been to build our test suite relying on extensive pre-existing, linguistically motivated spatial language research (e.g., Bloom et al., 1996, Herskovits, 1986; Jackendoff, 1983; Lindstromberg, 1998; Olivier and Gapp, 1998; Vandeloise, 1992).",

        "In order to assess how accurately and consistently MT systems handle spatial language and how effectively second language learners are being taught about spatial language, we followed these steps in constructing a spatial expressions evaluation dataset.",
        "We first built a master list of English prepositions from several sources (Lindstromberg, 1998; Websters, website) and then created a sublist of only spatial prepositions, based on the judgments of three native English speakers, two of whom were linguistically trained and one who was not.",
        "Second, we constructed English sentences where the spatial PP was systematically composed into different syntactic positions, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "This enabled us to examine the range of Path/Place-type ambiguity in the resulting spatial expressions.",
        "The spatial prepositions were placed in contexts where only one place or path interpretation was feasible, as well as in contexts where the reading was ambiguous.",
        "For example, PP's with the preposition across were composed in (i) a verb's subcategorized argument for the verbs live and dance, as in 'he lived/danced [PP across the street]', (ii) as a verb's non-subcategorized argument for the verbs scare and sneeze, as in 'he scared the child [PP across the street]' and `he sneezed the cards [PP across the table]', and (iii) as an adjunct outside the VP for the verb eat, as in 'he ate dinner [PP across the street]'.",
