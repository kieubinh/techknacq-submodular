        "• theoretical assumptions: compared systems may be based on different theoretical frameworks; • multi – linguality: parsers are often optimally designed to deal with a particular language or family of languages; • multi – modality: systems tend to be special",
        "ized for dealing with a specific type of input, i.e. written or spoken language.",
        "As to the first point, it is important that alternative annotation schemes be evaluated (i) on the basis of the linguistic information they are intended to provide, and (ii) in terms of the utility of this information with respect to a particular task.",
        "Moreover, multi – linguality and multi – modality are crucial parameters for evaluating the robustness and portability of a given parser, with a view to the growing need for embedding NLP systems into multi – modal and multi – medial applications.",
        "An essential aspect of every evaluation campaign is the specification of an annotation scheme into which the output of the participant systems is converted and on whose basis the system performance is eventually evaluated.",
        "A suitable annotation scheme must satisfy some requirements.",
        "First of all, it should be able to represent the information relevant to a certain evaluation task in a way which is naturally conducive to quantitative evaluation.",
        "Secondly, it should easily be mappable onto different system outputs, and flexible enough to deal with multilingual phenomena and with the specific nature of both written and spoken language.",
        "The aim of this paper is to illustrate FAME, a Functional Annotation Meta – scheme for Evaluation.",
        "We will show that it complies with the above mentioned requirements, and lends itself to effectively being used in comparative evaluation campaigns of parsing systems.",
        "There are two main features of FAME that will receive particular emphasis here: it is functional and it is a meta – scheme.",
        "We claim that these two features are essential for meeting the specific requirements of comparative parsing evaluation, while tackling issues of multi – linguality and multi – modality in a principled fashion."

      "text": [
        "The choice of evaluating parsing systems at the functional level is largely motivated on the basis of a number of practical concerns.",
        "We contend that information about how functional relations are actually instantiated in a text is important for the following reasons:",
        "• it is linguistically valuable, both as an end in itself and as an intermediate linguistic resource; in fact, it is sufficiently close to semantic representations to be used as an intermediate stage of analysis in systems requiring full text understanding capabilities;",
        "• it is likely to become a more and more heavily used information asset in its own right for NLP applications: a shift of emphasis from purely pattern matching methods operating on n – word windows to functional information about word pairs has recently been witnessed both in the context of information retrieval/filtering systems (Grefenstette, 1994) and for the purposes of word sense disambiguation (see the last SEN-SEVAL and ROMANSEVAL evaluation campaigns); • it is comparatively easy and \"fair\" to evaluate since it overcomes some of the shortcomings of constituency – based evaluation (Carroll and Briscoe, 1996; Carroll et al., 1998; Sampson, 1998; Lin, 1998); • it represents a very informative \"lowest common ground\" of a variety of different syntactic annotation schemes (Lin, 1998); • it is naturally multi – lingual, as functional relations probably represent the most significant level of syntactic analysis at which cross – language comparability makes sense; • it permits joint evaluation of systems dealing with both spoken and written language.",
        "Spoken data are typically fraught with cases of dis-fluency, anacoluthon, syntactic incompleteness and any sort of non-canonical syntactic structure (Antoine, 1995): the level of functional analysis naturally reflects a somewhat standardized representation, which abstracts away from the surface realization of syntactic units in a sentence, thus being relatively independent of, and unconcerned with disfluency phenomena and phrase partials (Klein et al., 1998); • it is \"lexical\" enough in character to make provision for partial and focused annotation: since a functional relation always involves two lexical heads at a time, as opposed to complex hierarchies of embedded constituents, it is comparatively easy to evaluate an annotated text only relative to a subset of the actually occurring headwords, e.g. those carrying a critical information weight for the intended task and/or specific domain."

      "heading": "2.2 Why an annotation meta – scheme",
      "text": [
        "FAME is designed to meet the following desiderata:",
        "• provide not only a measure of coverage but also of the utility of the covered information as opposed to missing information; • make explicit, through annotation, information which is otherwise only indirectly derivable from the parsed text; • factor out linguistically independent (but possibly correlated) primitive dimensions of functional information.",
        "All these requirements serve the main purpose of making evaluation open to both annotation – dependent and task – dependent parameterization.",
        "This is felt important since the definition of closeness to a standard, and the utility of an analysis that is less – than – perfect along some dimension can vary from task to task, and, perhaps more crucially, from annotation scheme to annotation scheme.",
        "The basic idea underpinning the design of the annotation meta-scheme is that information about how functional relations are actually instantiated in context can be factored out into linguistically independent levels.",
        "In many cases, this can in fact be redundant, as information at one level can be logically presupposed by a piece of information encoded at another level: for example, \"nominative case\" is often (but not always) a unique indicator of \"subjecthood\", and the same holds for grammatical agreement.",
        "Yet, there is a general consensus that redundancy should not be a primary concern in the design of a standard representation, as syntactic schemes often differ from each other in the way levels of information are mutually implied, rather than in the intrinsic nature of these levels (Sanfilippo et al., 1996).",
        "By assuming that all levels are, in a sense, primitive, rather than some of them being derivative of others, one provides considerable leeway for radically different definitions of functional relations to be cast into a common, albeit redundant, core of required information.",
        "We will return to this point in section 3 of the paper.",
        "To be more concrete, a binary functional relationship can be represented formally as consisting of the following types of information:",
        "i. the unordered terms of the relationship (i.e. the linguistic units in text which enter a given functional relationship): example (give, Mary); ii.",
        "the order relationship between the terms considered, conveying information about the head and the dependent: example <give, Mary>; iii.",
        "the type of relationship involved: example, the functional relation of the pair (give, Mary) in the sentence John gave the book to Mary is \"indirect object\"; iv.",
        "morpho – syntactic features associated with the dependent and the head; e.g. the dependent in the pair (give, Mary) is \"non-clausal\"; v. the predicate – argument status of the terms involved: for example give(John, book, Mary) in John gave the book to Mary.",
        "Most available tag taxonomies for functional annotation (such as those provided by, e.g., Karls",
        "son's Constraint Grammar (Karlsson et al., 1995), or the SPARKLE annotation scheme (Carroll et al., 1996), to mention but two of them) typically collapse the levels above into one level only, for reasons ranging from a theoretical bias towards a maximally economic description of the phenomena in question or a particular view of the way syntactic phenomena are mutually implied from a logical standpoint, to choices chiefly motivated by the intended application.",
        "A typical example of this is the tag xcomp in the SPARKLE scheme, which (following LFG) covers all subcategorized open predicates: namely, traditional predicative complements (whether subject or object predicative), and unsaturated clausal complements, such as embedded infinitival and participial clauses (as opposed to, e.g., that-clauses).",
        "In Constraint Grammar, predicative nominal and adjectival phrases are tagged as \"subject complement\" or \"object complement\", while, say, controlled infinitive clauses, as in Mary wants to read, are marked functionally as an \"object\" of the main verb.",
        "Any context-free attempt to map SPARKLE xcomp onto a Constraint Grammar tag, would inevitably be one-to-many and not necessarily information-preserving.",
        "Clearly, both these aspects make it very hard to provide any sort of fair baseline for comparing a SPARKLE annotated text against the same text tagged with Constraint Grammar labels.",
        "The design of a meta-scheme is intended to tackle these difficulties by spelling out the levels of information commonly collapsed into each tag.",
        "More concretely, SPARKLE xcomp (want , leave) , for the sentence She wants to leave, appears to convey two sorts of information: (a) that leave is a complement of want, (b) that leave is an open predicate.",
        "Both pieces of information can be evaluated independently against levels i, ii, iii and v above.",
        "Surely, a translation into FAME is not guaranteed to always be information preserving.",
        "For example, xcomp (want ,leave) can also be interpreted as conveying information about the intended functional control of leave, given some (lexical) information about the main verb want, and some (contextual) information concerning the absence of a direct object in the sentence considered.",
        "However, this sort of context-sensitive translation would involve a more or less complete reprocessing of the entire output representation.1 In our view, a partial context-free translation into FAME represents a sort of realistic compromise between a fairly uninformative one-to-many mapping and the complete translation of the information conveyed by one scheme into another 'In fact, the SPARKLE annotation scheme annotates control information explicitly, as illustrated later in the paper: the point here is simply that this information cannot be derived directly from xcomp(vant,leave).",

        "As a more charitable alternative to this evaluation, it can be suggested that the difference between the FAME standard and the Fast Partial Parser output is the consequence of theory internal assumptions concerning the analysis of subject-control structures, and that this difference should eventually be leveled out in the translation into FAME.",

        "Scoring can be a function of the reliability of speech recognition in the word lattice, so that the parser can start off from the most-reliably recognized word(s).",

        "We already considered (section 2.3.1) the issue of tagging sentential complements as arg, as a way to circumvent the theoretical issue of whether the functional relations of clauses should be defined on the basis of their predicative status, or, alternatively, of their syntactic distribution.",
        "To sum up, underspecification thus guarantees a more flexible and balanced evaluation of the system outputs, especially relative to those constructions whose syntactic analysis is controversial."

        "The suggestion of using a functional meta-scheme as a fair basis for parsing evaluation rests on the idea that parsing systems must be assessed for what they are intended to provide, not for how well they meet the requisites of other annotation schemes.",
        "Still, it makes a lot of sense to compare the amount of information provided by different parsers by casting this information into a common format.",
        "The distributed information structure of FAME is conducive to an incremental evaluation procedure, which ranges from a base evaluation level (involving sheer identification of the terms of a syntactic relationship and/or their order), to more refined levels, including morpho-syntactic information, dependency type, and ultimately predicate-argument structure.",
        "The evaluation of a text annotated for functional information can then be conceived of as a function of estimating precision and recall for each of the independent evaluation levels envisaged.",
        "Evaluation results obtained for the different levels can eventually be combined together or, for particular purposes, assessed in their own right (e.g. for IR applications the basic evaluation level could be sufficient).",
        "We are considering the possibility of extending FAME through addition of still further levels of lingustic information."
