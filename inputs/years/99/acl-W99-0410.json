        "EVALING is a Leonardo da Vinci project funded by the European Union, involving four European laboratories.",
        "The aim of the project is to build an automatic system to evaluate language skills in people's mother language.",
        "Each partner is working on his own language and building specific tests (at the present:",
        "French, Italian and German).",
        "In this paper we will present French.",
        "The first step consists, for each language, in determining the fields to be tested and the types of exercises which can be computerized to carry out this task.",
        "We have observed this task differs from one language to another.",
        "For example, spelling exercises are relevant in French, but they are not very interesting for German, since people make few mistakes.",
        "For French, we decided to focus on syntax, lexicon, spelling and reading comprehension.",
        "Hence, we oriented the reflection on the tests that could be automatized and on those that could not.",
        "At this point, automatization in the EVALING sytsem bears on three phases of the evaluation process: - dynamic setting up of tests (exercises are stored in tables of an exercise database).",
        "We assume that if a person has to take the test more than once, this person should not get the same set of questions twice, - automatic grading of tests (including storage of marks in a client database), - semi-automatic filling of exercise databases (with the assistance of linguistic tools).",
        "First, we will discuss some technical aspects: EVALING is a Web-based program interacting with large exercise databases and a client database.",
        "We will explain how this 'item Banking' system has been implemented on a Web Server as an ISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming for Microsoft Information Server3) and how exercise databases were built.",
        "This last point is a key issue, because the aim is not so much to gather a fixed amount",
        "of exercises, but rather to be able to renew them easily.",
        "We designed a set of linguistic tools to satisfy this demand.",
        "The set of tools is based on the software INTEX, developed at the LADL by Max Silberztein4.",
        "Of course, it is not always possible to automatize the creation of exercises.",
        "In certain cases, the work will have to be done manually.",
        "Second, we will present the 'Administrator side'.",
        "We call 'administrator' the person or team who needs to evaluate a large group (students, employees, applicants, etc.).",
        "An interface enables the administrator to define the parameters of the test (length, level, etc.)",
        "and to perform some statistical analysis on the client database.",
        "Finally, we will deal with the 'client side'.",
        "The client registers himself and then has access to the test sesion through a Web-Client software.",
        "All test forms are in HTML form."

        "From a technical point of view, EVALING uses a Multithreaded Automation Object.",
        "This technology allows multiple threads of execution (Apartment-model threading).",
        "Thus, the EVALING kernel is an 'Active X DLL'.",
        "In the DLL, all exercises are designed on a single module which makes it easier to develop and manage the whole system.",
        "In fact, in order to add or remove exercises, we just have to add or remove modules and to change a global variable in the main module which indicates to the system the number of exercises and their order in the session.",
        "The system is developed to run with Microsoft Information Server and works as a server application.",
        "Sets of exercises passed down to a client are dynamically composed by the system at the time of the user's request.",
        "All exercises are stored in tables of the Exercise database.",
        "For each questionnaire, the system extracts a set of",
        "4 INTEX is a parsing system based on wide coverage dictionaries and local grammars (represented by Finite State Automata) which applies to lage corpora, that is 100Mo.",
        "Cf. Silberztein (1993).",
        "exercises from a table.",
        "Each record in the table corresponds to one sentence, or one short text.",
        "Therefore, several records are retrieved by the system to constitute the questionnaire that will be sent to the client.",
        "Corrections of the user's answers are provided by JavaScript programs that use data of hidden fields in HTML form or by more complex programs running on the server when necessary.",
        "When we make use of JavaScript programs to correct a form, we never display answers clearly in the JavaScript source (functions that take ASCII values or binary values evaluate the validity of answers).",
        "Answers are therefore not readable in HTML source code.",
        "This practice is a second level of protection, because the whole test session occurs in a Browser Window that does not contain the menu bar that allows the view source action.",
        "It is imperative that sets of exercises have the same level of difficulty from one client to another.",
        "To signal this stability, a field in each record indicates the level of difficulty.",
        "When the EVALING system composes a questionnaire, records are chosen in such a way that the sum of the difficulty marks is always the same (this sum is given by the administrator who can choose the global level of difficulty).",
        "Grading occurs at the development time.",
        "A script, which uses linguistic tools (INTEX programs, local grammars, dictionaries and linguistic descriptions) evaluates the sentences.",
        "For French, the difficulty of a sentence depends on: length in words, -presence/absence of negation, conjunction, relative pronoun, lexical difficulty: to measure this parameter, we use an electronic dictionary: the DELAF dictionary for French that contains more than 900.000 inflected forms.",
        "It is divided into three levels of difficulty: common and easy words constitute the first level, technical and unusual words the third level and in between, we have a second level consisting of words whose understanding is hazy.",
        "The dynamic design of a questionnaire requires large databases, with a large number of sentences for each exercise.",
        "It is costly to produce all of them manually.",
        "To avoid such a difficulty, we designed a set of search tools that apply to large corpora and retrieve sentences or",
        "short texts that match a given linguistic pattern.",
        "These tools constitute a full-fledged parser based on the use of Finite State Transducers (FST)5.",
        "They use morpho-syntactic information provided by wide coverage electronic dictionaries6, allowing us to retrieve accurate linguistic information7.",
        "The software INTEX includes a graphic editor (FSGraph) which allows ergonomic designing of FSTs (which are graphically represented as graphs).",
        "Linguists or other non computer scientists can easily design and maintain FST libraries.",
        "Graphs can be used in three modes8: 'simple mode' for retrieval purpose, 'fusion mode' for inserting patterns in the recognized sequence and 'replace mode' for substituting a pattern to the one matched by the graph.",
        "For example, the following graph, when used in 'simple mode', locates in a text the patterns displayed in the boxes (inputs) and, when used in 'replace mode', it substitutes to the input the text displayed below the boxes (outputs)."

        "We built two types of exercises: First, we have a set of exercises whose correction consists of comparing the user",
        "answers to the solutions registered in the database.",
        "This elementary way of scoring is used for exercises where the number of different correct answers is limited (generally to one or two possibilities).",
        "User answers are evaluated as either right or wrong, with no intermediate scores.",
        "On the screen, the exercise can take the appearance of a multiple choice test (if we add distractors) or of a form to complete (if we remove from the original sentence patterns to be tested).",
        "Our methodology produces this kind of exercise easily and economically.",
        "Since we extract the items for these exercises from corpora, all items we put in the database are well-formed items9.",
        "Thus, the validity check of the users answers can be a simple string comparison.",
        "The example below underline this simplicity (cf. 1.3 Sample of exercise development).",
        "Second, we are working on the conception of exercises where expected answers are more free, but not completely.",
        "In this case, scoring is performed by means of specialized grammars.",
        "Technically, these grammars are also Finite State Transducers.",
        "They describe all possible structures of a given context.",
        "Because these grammars are specialized to the descriptions of limited contexts, they are called 'local grammars'.",
        "Local grammars introduce a lot of flexibility for rating exercises.",
        "We are testing two ways of scoring: binary scoring (right/wrong) and multi-value scales.",
        "In the first case, we use a grammar in 'simple mode' to verify an answer: answer matched by the grammar is valid, otherwise it is considered wrong.",
        "In the second case, the grammar is used in 'replace mode': if a path of the grammar matches the answer, the output combined to the path is produced.",
        "This output can be a score or a formal information processed later by a scoring program.",
        "It is thus possible to produce different outputs (scores), and even outputs for each path of the graph.",

        "In this way, the followings utterances are matched by the graph: s'est fait avoir, se faisait avoir, etc.",
