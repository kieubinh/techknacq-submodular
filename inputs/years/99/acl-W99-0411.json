        "Research and development in automated essay scoring has begun to flourish in the past five years or so, bringing about a whole new field of interest to the NLP community (Burstein, et al. (1998a, 1998b and 1998c), Foltz, et al. (1998), Larkey (1998), Page and Peterson (1995)).",
        "Research at Educational Testing Service (ETS) has led to the recent development of e-rater, an operational automated essay scoring system.",
        "E-rater is based on features in holistic scoring guides for human reader scoring.",
        "Scoring guides have a 6-point score scale.",
        "Six's are assigned to the \"best\" essays, and \"1 ' s\" to the least well-written.",
        "Scoring guide criteria are based on structural (syntax and discourse) and vocabulary usage in essay responses (see htIat.org).",
        "E-rater builds new models for each topic (prompt-specific models) by evaluating approximately 52 syntactic, discourse and topical analysis variables for 270 human reader scored training essays.",
        "Relevant features for each model are based on the predictive feature set identified by a stepwise linear regression.",
        "In operational scoring, when compared to a human reader,",
        "e-rater assigns an exactly matching or adjacent score (on the 6-point scale) about 92% of the time.",
        "This is the same as the agreement rate typically found between two human readers.",
        "Correlations between e-rater scores and those of a single human reader are about .73; correlations between two human readers are .75.",
        "The scoring guide criteria assume standard written English.",
        "Non-standard English may show up in the writing of native English speakers of non-standard dialects.",
        "For general NLP research purposes, it is useful to have computer-based corpora that represent language variation (Biber (1993)).",
        "Such corpora allow us to explore issues with regard to how the system will handle responses that might be written in nonstandard English.",
        "Current research at ETS for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) (Burstein, et al., 1999) is making use of essay corpora that represent subgroups where variations in standard written English might be found, such as in the writing of African Americans, Latinos and Asians (Breland, et al. (1995) and Bridgeman and McHale (1996)).",
        "In addition, ETS is accumulating essay corpora of nonnative speakers that can be used for research.",
        "This paper focuses on preliminary data that show e-rater's performance on Test of Written English (TWE) essay responses written by nonnative English speakers whose native language is Chinese, Arabic, or Spanish.",
        "A small sample of the data is from US-born English speakers and a second small sample is from non-US-born candidates who report that their native language is English.",
        "The data were originally collected for a study by Frase, et al. (1997) in which analyses of the essays are also discussed.",
        "The current work is only the beginning of a program of research at ETS that will examine automated scoring for nonnative English speakers.",
        "Overall goals include determining how features used in automated scoring may also be used to (a) examine the difficulty of an essay question for speakers of particular language groups, and (b) automatically formulate diagnostics and instruction for nonnative English speakers, with customization for different language groups."

        "The driving concept that underlies e-rater is that it needs to evaluate the same kinds of features that human readers do.",
        "This is why from the beginning of its development, we made it a priority to use features from the scoring guide and to eliminate any direct measures of essay length.",
        "Even though length measures can be shown to be highly correlated with human reader essay scores, length variables are not scoring guide criteria (Page and Peterson, 1995).",
        "The features currently used by the system are syntactic features, discourse cue words, terms and structures, and topical analysis, specifically, vocabulary usage at the level of the essay (big bag of words) and at the level of the argument.",

        "The e-rater system uses an ETS-enhanced version of the CASS syntactic chunker (Abney (1996)), referred to here as the parser.",
        "The parser identifies several syntactic structures in the essay responses, such as subjunctive auxiliary verbs (e.g., would, should, might), and complex clausal structures, such as complement, infinitive, and subordinate clauses.",
        "Recognition of such features in an essay yields information about its syntactic variety."

      "heading": "1.2 Discourse Cues and Organization of Ideas",
      "text": [
        "Organization of ideas is another criterion that the scoring guide asks human readers to consider in assigning essay score.",
        "E-rater contains a lexicon based on the conceptual framework of conjunctive relations from Quirk, et al. (1985) in which cue terms, such as \"In summary\" and \"In conclusion,\" are classified as conjuncts used for summarizing.",
        "The conjunct classifiers contain information about whether or not the item is a kind of discourse development term (e.g., \"for example\" and \"because\"), or whether it is more likely to be used to begin a discourse statement (e.g., First, Second, or Third).",
        "E-rater also contains heuristics that define the syntactic or essay-based structures in which these terms must appear to be considered as discourse markers.",
        "For example, for the word \"first\" to be considered a discourse marker, it must not be a nominal modifier, as in the sentence, \"The first time I went to Europe was in 1982,\" in which \"first\" modifies the noun \"time.\"",
        "Instead, \"first\" must occur as an adverbial conjunct to be considered a discourse marker, as in the sentence, \"First, it has often been noted that length is highly correlated with essay score.\"",
        "The cue term lexicon and the associated heuristics are used by e-rater to automatically annotate a high-level discourse structure of each essay.",
        "These annotations are also used by the system to partition each essay into separate arguments which are input to the system's topical analysis component, described below, for analyzing topical content."

        "Good essays are relevant to the assigned topic.",
        "They also tend to use a more specialized and precise vocabulary in discussing the topic than poorer essays do.",
        "We should therefore expect a good essay to resemble other good essays in its choice of words and, conversely, a poor essay to resemble other poor ones.",
        "To capture use of vocabulary or identification of topic, e-rater uses content vector analyses that are based on the vector-space model commonly found in information retrieval applications.",
        "Training essays are converted into vectors of word frequencies, and the frequencies are then transformed into word weights.",
        "These weight vectors populate the training space.",
        "To score a test essay, it is converted into a weight vector, and a search is conducted to find the training vectors most similar to it, as measured by the cosine between the test and training vectors.",
        "The closest matches among the training set are used to assign a score to the test essay.",
        "E-rater uses two different forms of the general procedure sketched above.",
        "In one form, for looking at topical analysis at the essay level, each of the 270 training essays is represented by a separate vector in the training space.",
        "The score assigned to the test essay is a weighted mean of the scores for the 6 training essays whose vectors are closest to the vector of the test essay.",
        "This 2 Word (or term) weight reflects not only a word's frequency in the essay but also its distribution across essays.",
        "E-rater's formula for the weight of word w in essay j is:",
        "where freqwj is the frequency of word w in essay j, maxfreqj is the frequency of the most frequent word in essay j, nessays is the total number of training essays, and essaysw is the number of training essays that contain w. The first part of the formula measures the relative importance of the word in the essay.",
        "The second part gauges its specificity across essays, so that a word that appears in many essays will have a lower weight than one which appears in only a few.",
        "In the extreme case, a word that appears in all essays (e.g., \"the\") has a weight of 0.",
        "score point in the 270 training essays is as follows: five O's, fifteen l's, and fifty 2's through 6's.3 score is computed using the following formula, rounded to the nearest integer: Score for test essay t = y,(cosine, * score;)/E cosineo where j ranges over the 6 closest training essays, score; is the human rater score for training essay j, and cosine, is the cosine between test essay t and training essay j.",
        "The other form of content vector analysis that the system uses combines all of the training essays for each score category and populates the training space with just 6 \"supervectors\", one each for scores 1-6.",
        "This method is used to evaluate the vocabulary usage at the argument level.",
        "The test essay is evaluated one argument at a time.",
        "Each argument is converted into a vector of word weights and compared to the 6 vectors in the training space.",
        "The closest vector is found and its score is assigned to the argument.",
        "This process continues until all the arguments have been assigned a score.",
        "The overall score for the test essay is an adjusted mean of the argument scores using the following formula, rounded to the nearest integer: Score for test essay t =",
        "where j ranges over the arguments in test essay t, argscore; is the score of argument j, and nargs, is the number of arguments in t. Using this adjusted mean has the overall effect of reducing, slightly, the score for essays with few arguments, and of increasing somewhat the score of essays with many arguments."

        "The models that e-rater built to score 1'WE1 and TWE2 contain 7 or 8 features, and these include syntactic, discourse and topical analysis features.",
        "Importantly, at least 4 of the top 5 features that are included in the current operational models also appear in the models for TWEl and 1'WE2.",
        "It is useful to know that even when 75% of essays used for model building were written by nonnative English speakers (as in this study), the features selected by the regression procedure were largely the same as those in models based on operational writing samples in which the majority of the sample were native English speakers.",
        "This suggests that the features that the system considers are generalizable from native speaker writing to nonnative speaker writing.",
        "Further, e-rater was not confounded by non-standard English syntactic structures or stylistic discourse structures, which one might expect to be a problem for a system designed to evaluate native speaker writing.",
        "Although there were significant differences between final human reader score and e-rater score across language groups, in absolute terms the differences were small (only a fraction of a score point) and did not produce significant differences in agreement.",
        "For one group, prompt made a difference.",
        "It would be useful to analyze the essays in more detail to see what features are responsible for the score variations and how essay topic might explain any differences due to prompt.",
        "We are currently investigating the use of tree-based regression models to supplement linear regression (Sheehan, 1997).",
        "Preliminary analyses of tree-based regressions, however, do not show an improvement in e-rater performance.",
        "This may be explained by the fact that the most predictive features in e-rater are linearly related to score.",
        "In future studies, we will have sufficient data to build individual models for different language groups to examine how this affects e-rater' s performance.",
        "In addition, we hope to learn about how building language-specific models can be used for automated generation of diagnostic and instructional feedback -- perhaps customized for different language groups."
