        "The work of Levin (1993) presents a classification of the alternations in which the English verbs participate This author presents 8 groups in which she differentiates several subgroups The first three include the greater number of structures and seem to follow generalization criteria The other alternations are classified in a more random fashion since either vely specific groups of alternations are proposed or non-semantically related alternations are gi ouped together Other authois have made explicit the subcategorization frames in which verbs can participate without using pair association In these cases a list of the structures in which a verb participates is presented Gioss's (1975) and Saint-Dizier's (1996) work is an example of such a methodology applied to French In it, one of the structures in each class is granted priority From our point of view, it is of interest to delimit a class according to the participation of its members in a given structure provided that this construction illustrates some semantic characteristics shared by the verbs With this idea in mind, we also point to the work of WIHems (1981) This author considers that the members of a semantic class do not",
        "necessarily share the same syntactic charactenstics and that factors such as the degree of concretion of the verb and the morphosyntactic composition must be taken into account It is of considerable interest to contemplate this type of phenomena in order to overcome the obstacle found with classifications based on the number and type of arguments The authors who focus on the syntactic-semantic structures, such as Devis Marquez (1993), consider that each one of the different syntactic structures that a verb takes has a different meaning and that a semantic opposition is thereby established among the diffeient frames With regard to the representation of information, NLP oriented formalisms usually include information about the subcategonzation required by the verb It can be shown by declaring the list of structures in which the verb participates (Sager 1981), or these structures can also be generated from one frame as is the case of the LFG (Kaplan & Bresnan 1982), GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985), and HPSG (Pollard & Sag 1987) We propose that given a type hierarchy of verb entries, the rules that account for syntactic behavior regarding alternations have to be associated to the representative type of a vet b group in order to express interesting linguistic generalizations In these types, the participation of a set of verbs in a particular alternation and the mechanism required to express it must be specified Works carried out along these lines are those of Sant)lippo (1990) and Thule (1995) within the Acquitlex project"

        "verbs can be semantically classified based on the meaning they share The hypothesis is that the verbs of a semantic class will share the same syntactic behavior Hence, each semantic class is associated with the constructions in which the verbs of that group participate In our approach, we consider that relevant semantic information can be deduced from the syntactic behavior Thus, our semantic analysis includes a syntactic study of the subcategorization frames in which different verbs can be found For this reason, in contrast to the above mentioned authors, we do not infer syntactic behavior from the semantic characterization but rather it is syntax that helps us to complete this semantic description We also consider that this relation can be formalized, and that it is essential for the characterization of the entries The three elements around which the information that makes up the verbal lexical entry is organized are meaning components, event structure and diathesis alternations With regard to meaning components, we draw principally from Talmy (1985) According to this author, these components play a central role in defining verbal semantic classes In our approach we have defined a small group of semantic components that we have organized into several levels The levels range from the mole general to the more specific The first level is common to all the predicates and accounts for Entity The second level serves us to distinguish events from states only the first ones can have an Initiator At a third level we specify those components relevant for grouping verbs into semantic classes Change, Attitude, Transference, etc The components considered at a more specific level allow us to characterize pi edicates, but not to define new classes Instrument, etc From the standpoint of iealization, they can be expressed .a the item' (e g La pared se desplonic■ I The wall crashed) or else syntagmatically (e g El pancipe se transform6 en mina I The prince turned into a frog) As concerns event structure, we follow Parsons' (1990) and Pustejovsky's (1995) By means of lextLalization tncorporanon or else it an be under stood works These authors consider that an event can be decomposed into a subatomic structure in which the temporal relations established between the subevents and the participants are described In this sense, several patterns of eventual behavior have been established They interact with the other elements that constitute our model Finally, our model pi esents infotmation about diathesis alternations This is the subject of this paper and acts as the basis for the veil) classification we present here We have formalized this information in the Pirdpides Lexical Knowledge Base (PLKB) in the form of modules In it, the types corresponding to each one of the modules that form the entry have been made explicit Also, the diathesis alternations have been dealt with as lexical rules An extra module, FORLOG, has been defined to account for the relation between semantics and syntax, connecting all the information to be found"

        "Our starting point for the study of alternations is Levin's (1993) work Unlike this author, we think that it is important to take into account only those very general alternations (middle, causative-inchoative ), that explain relevant syntactic behavior and that ieally highlight the relation between syntax and semantics Those constructions that are very specific and in which vely few veibs pal tictpate, such as Obligatory Adyetb (8 5), have been left aside In our proposal we understand diatheses as one of the syntagmatic expressions of a semantic opposition Diathesis alternations are thus pairs of structures (or diatheses) related to each other by one of these oppositions With this concept in mind we have considered the existence of three possible oppositions depending on whether theie is a change of focus in the participants (Change of focus and Underspecification) or there is a change in the event structure (Aspectual Opposition) For example, the sentences",
