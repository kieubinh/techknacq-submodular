        "SIMPLE is a large-scale Eutopean lexicon project funded by the European Commission with the participation of 12 European countries The aim of the project is to add harmonized semantic information to the LE-PAROLE lexicons', which contain motphological and syntactic information In this paper we present some examples of concrete nouns from the Danish SIMPLE lexicon which illustrate two central aspects of the SIMPLE model 1) the expressive power of the Qualta Structure exemplified with a phenomenon relevant to a Scandinavian language like Danish namely the iepresentation of the internal structure of Danish non-devei bal nominal compounds, and 2) the leptesentation ol iegular polysemy in the Danish SIMPLE lexicon"

        "The SIMPLE model is primarily based on three lexical flameworks (Lent et al., 1998) The Geneiative Lexicon (cf Pustejovsky, 1995), WoidNet (cf Miller and Fellbaum, 1991), and EuroWordNet (ct Vossen et al., 1998) The basic underlying assumption in the model is that word senses diffei in teims of their Internal complexity Hence the SIMPLE model consists of three different semantic types (I) simple types, which can be characterized in terms of I The LE-PAROLE lexicons contain 20,000 entries with corresponding morphological and syntactic information for each of the 12 languages that participated in this project, which was also funded by the European Commission (ct Rill my et (II, 1998) monodimensional relations, (n) unified types, which involve multidimensional information, and (iii) complex types, which identify regular polysemous classes One of the basic tasks during the SIMPLE lexicon encoding phase is the assignment of semantic typing to the word senses to be encoded (called the semantic units or Serrais) A set of schematic structures called 'templates' constituting the SIMPLE Ontology (consisting of approx 140 semantic types in all) guides this encoding process A template is a cohort of various different information types which is primarily used by the lexicon encoder to express the semantic type of a word sense, but also to express its domain, definition, predicative representation, argument structure, polysemous classes, etc The multiple dimensions of meaning are represented in SIMPLE by the use of the Qualia Structure from the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995) to represent lexical meaning expressed by means of orthogonal inheritance The Qualm Structure involves tour different roles (1) the formal tole, which piovides information that distinguishes an entity within a latger set, (11) the agentive role, which conceins the origin of an entity, (iii) the telic role, which concerns the typical function of an entity, and (iv) the constitutive role, which expresses a variety of relations concerning the internal constitution of an entity As an illustration, consider in Figure 1 the meaning components involved in the noun pudding",
        "pudding The central meaning aspects are mirrored in the linguistic contexts surrounding the word, so for pudding we could have John refused the pudding referring to the eat event, that's an easy pudding referring to the make event, there is pudding on the floor referring to the substance dimension, and that was a nice bread pudding referring to the ingredients of which it is made As an example of the semantic types expiessed in the SIMPLE Ontology and of how the different dimensions of meaning are involved for each semantic type, consider Figure 2 which shows a subset of the SIMPLE ontology referring to human beings",
        "Some examples of word senses encoded as simple types are russer (a Russian) under the template type 'people', ode (Jew) under 'ideo', kusine (female cousin) under 'kinship, and yen (friend) under 'social status' These senses may naturally involve additional dimensions of meaning, however they are not considered th.",
        ":,.> defining in the SIMPLE model In contrast, word senses encoded under the emphasised boxes above, such as borddame (female dinner partner) under 'agent of temporary activity', alkoholiker (an alcoholic) under 'agent of persistent activity', and liege (doctor) under 'profession', are unified types These are identified by more than one coordinate in the type hieiarchy, since they involve more than one type-defining dimension of meaning Thus 'agent of temporary activity' also involves an agentive role For borddame this is defined by the act of sitting next to someone at a dinner 'Agent of persistent activity' and 'profession' involve a telic role, which for alkoholiker is the act of drinking, and for huge is the act of curing 2 Danish nommal compounds denoting containers: expressing their internal structure via the Qualia Structure The internal semantic structure of Danish deverbal nominal compounds (i e flisebeltegrung (flagging, lit 'flagstone paving'))",
        "can to some extent be identified by the argument structure of the derived verb and the internal ranking of its arguments (cf Orsnes, 1995) In contrast, non-deverbal nominal compounds generally display a more arbitrary internal structure in Danish (cf Paggio & Orsnes 1993), and hence they require a higher degree of expressive power in the lexical entries The Qualia Structure as it is expressed in the SIMPLE model provides a good basis for a lexicalised encoding of Danish non-deverbal nominal compounds, as for example nominal compounds denoting containers The template type 'Container' belongs to the set of templates constituting the SIMPLE Core Ontology It is a unified type that has the unification path 'Concrete entity + Artifact/Agentive + Teltc' This indicates that the template denotes a kind of concrete entity, and that it has been augmented with two kinds of additional type-defining information (i) agentive information (namely that these concrete entities are man-made artifacts), and (n) telic information (namely that these concrete entities are used for a specific purpose to contain things) All Danish containers encoded under this template type have been encoded with Danish information about the formal role via an ts_ahieraichy As a default, beholder (container) is chosen as hypernym for the Danish containers in the is_a-hierarchy Since containers are (man-made) artifacts, the process of their creation is specified via the agentive role Foi Danish containers this is the process fremsttlle (to create) As is apparent from the unification path for this template, containers are also encoded with the type-defining telic information that their function is to contain things For Danish containers this is specified with the verb mdeholde (to contain) in the encoding of the telic iole The Quaha Structure used in the SIMPLE model is well-suited for capturing a majority of the internal telationships for Danish non-deverbal nominal compounds denoting containers As an example, the encoding of the meaning of a word like bceger (cup) can be further augmented with the telic role for such compounds as malebleger (measuring cup), raflebager (lit cup for casting dice = dice cup), or drikkebteger (drinking cup) In the SIMPLE model, the encoding of the meaning of Imeger can also be further specified by including information about the constitutive role for other types of compounds The encodings can include additional information on (i) the material of which the container is made, e g plasucbceger (plastic cup), messmgbteget (brass cup), or papbceger (paper cup), or (n) what the container (prototypically) contains, e g askelmeger (ashtray), gtftbceger (poisoned chalice), or yoghurtbceger (yoghurt cup) The following SGML-encoded examples from the Danish SIMPLE lexicon2 demonstrate the use of the SIMPLE Qualm.",
        "Structure to distinguish between different types of compound containers The first example shows the encoding of vtnflaske (wine bottle) This is shown to be a hyponym of flaske (bottle) in the formal is_a-relationship The encoding of vinflaske differs from flaske by the additional constitutive information expressing that it (prototypically) contains yin (wine) In the second example, the meaning of bmrepose (carrying bag) is linked to its hypernym pose (bag) in the is_a-hierarchy The encoding of bcerepose also contains the additional telic information that its prototypical function is to cany something (bcere) In the last example, the meaning of bltkdc7se (tin can) is shown to be a hyponym of da'se (can) in the is_a-hietarchy The encoding of blikdase also contains the additional constitutive infoimation that it is made of bilk (tin), whereas dcise would be underspecified with respect to this role 2 The SGML-encodings displayed here are slightly simplified versions of the actual Danish lexicon encodings The example sentences were taken from a composition of several Danish corpora (45 mill running words in all) The definitions marked '(NDO)' were taken from the CD-ROM edition of Politikens Store Nye Nudansl, Ordbog (1997)"

      "text": [
        "Regular polysemy - when groups of related words display the same ambiguity - is handled in a uniform way in the SIMPLE model via the identification of a set of well-established regular semantic classes, which are adjusted for each of the languages involved While unsystematic ambiguous readings of a word are represented as totally unrelated semantic units, regular polysemous senses can be encoded as interlinked semantic units In the SIMPLE model this is represented by an information slot called complex, whose value is the polysemous class to which the semantic unit belongs This strategy relates to Pustejovsky (1995), where regular polysemous classes correspond to complex types, which allows for an underspecified semantic typing of word senses The solution adopted in SIMPLE Intends to be a first step towards the future development of underspecified semantic types (Lenci et al., 1998) Empirically-based studies of regular polysemous semantic classes of Danish are at present very scarce (see however Boje & Schosler (ed ) (1992) pp 11-12 and Braasch & Pedersen (forthcoming) for some minor considerations of regular polysemy in Danish nouns as well as Malmgren (1988) for an extensive study of iegular polysemy in Swedish, a language which displays polysemous behaviour very similar to Danish) This fact underpins the need for corpus-oriented encoding procedures which have therefore been given a cential focus in the the Danish SIMPLE dictionary in the sense that each semantic encoding is supported by corpus examinations3 In the Danish lexicon the most productive cases of regular polysemy involving concrete nouns prove to be the following",
        "• animal / food",
        "3 We apply the corpus tool Xkwic on a composite corpus of 44 mill running words (consisting of 'Beilineske Korpus', 'Bergenholtz Korpus' and 'Parole Korpus')",
        "• geographical location / human gioup • fruit / plant • human group / institution • semiotic artifact / information",
        "Other well-known polysemous pairs are not productive in Danish, as for example 'people / language' and 'flower / colour', where only a few examples of each can be found This difference relates to the distinction made by Apresjan (apud Malmgren, 1988) between productive and iegular polysemy Here productive polysemy refers to cases where more or less the whole group of nouns within a semantic class display the same polysemy relations, whereas regular polysemy refers to cases where at least two words - but not the whole class - follow the same polysemy pattern Below is shown an example of the semantic encoding of a proper noun denoting a Danish city, which belongs to the productive 'geographical location / human group' polysemy This example shows the encoding of the 'human group' sense of the word This can be seen in the corpus example ('example'), the definition ('freedefinition'), and the kinds of qualm roles encoded We believe that the corpus-oriented approach used dunng the encoding of the Danish SIMPLE lexicon facilitates the identification of new polysemous classes, since the differences in distributional patterns of the encoded voids senses are a good indication of whether a regulat polysemy relation could be Involved",
