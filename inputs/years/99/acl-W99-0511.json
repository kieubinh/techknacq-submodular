        "As said before, DELAS is the dictionary of simple words We understand by simple words the lexical units that correspond to a continuous string of",
        "letters The lexical entries of DELAS have the following general structure <word>, <formal description> where word represents the canonical form (the lemma) of a simple lexical unit (in general the masculine singular for the nouns and adjectives, the infinitive for the verbs), and formal description corresponds to an alphanumeric code containing information on the grammatical attributes of the entries their grammatical class (eventually, sub-class), and their morphological behavior The inflected forms are automatically generated from the association of a lemma to an inflectional code the list of all inflected words constitutes the Portuguese DELAF (1,250,000 word forms) In Portuguese, the major grammatical classes nouns, adjectives and verbs have inflected forms - nouns and adjectives can appear in the feminine and/or in the plural, they can receive diminutive and augmentative suffixes, the superlative degree of the adjectives can be expressed by morphological means (suffixes), - verbs are conjugated (mood, tense, person, number), furthermore, some verbal forms can undergo formal modifications induced by the presence of a clitic pronoun Thus, the DELAS entries gato, NO1D1 gordo, AOIDIS1 (where N and A indicate that gato (cat) is a noun and gordo (fat) is an adjective, 01 corresponds to the inflection rule for masculine, feminine, singular and plural, DI and Si explicit the type of diminutive and superlative suffixes that can be accepted by these entries) produce the following infected forms (DELAF entries)",

        "As for the verbs, for instance, dar (to give) dar, VO2t gives rise to a list of 73 inflected forms that correspond to the normal conjugation of a non-defective verb, in addition, dar can be constructed with clitic pronouns (t), in the position of accusative and dative complements So, in (1)NOs demos o livro a Marta (Lit We gave the book to Maria) the verb form demos expresses indicative mood, past tense, and first person plural From a syntactic point of view, dar is constructed with three arguments, subject NOs (we) and two complements o Itvro (the book), a Marta (to Maria) The complement syntactic positions can be fulfilled by claw pronouns, respectively, o (it), accusative, and lhe (her), dative, as in (2) NOs demo-lo a Maria (Lit We gave it to Maria)",

        "The issue is even more acute if one considers the description of scientific or technical texts or any specialized lexicon, where the number of compounds can rise up to appalling figures As said in 2 compounds are structured in the Portuguese DELAC Priority was given to the listing and formalization of compound nouns, that can inflect lua de met - luas de mel (honeymoon), and to compound adverbs, that are invariable de repente (suddenly) From the point of view of the lexicon, the main focus, especially as far as compound nouns are concerned, has been the every-day, not too technical, lexicon In order to identify compound words, and distinguish them from formally identical word free combinations, a set of morpho-syntactic criteria was adopted (Ranchhod (1991), Baptista (1995)) In short, compounds are the sequences of words that present restrictions to the",
        "combinatorial properties that they were supposed to have The formalization of compound dictionary entries is similar to that of simple words Since compound adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions do not inflect, their formats are rather simple",
