        "The Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI) in the EuroWordNet architecture is an initially unstructured fund of concepts which functions as the link between the various language wordnets The ILI concepts originate from WordNetl 5, and have been restructured on the basis of aspects of the internal structure of Word-Net, links between WordNet and other resources, and multilingual mapping between the wordnets This leads to a differentiation of the status of ILI concepts, a reduction of the Wordnet polysemy, and a greater connectivity between the wordnets The restructured ILI represents the first step towards a standardized set of word meanings, is a working platform for further development and testing, and can be put to use in NLP tasks such as (multilingual) information retrieval"

        "EuroWordNet (LE2-4003, LE4-8328) develops a multilingual database with wordnets for 8 different European languages English, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Czech and Estonian Further collaborations have been established with ordnet builders for Poi tuguese, Swedish, Basque, Catalan, Russian, Gieek and Danish, who woik according to the EuroWoidNet specifications Each of the wordnets is structured as the Princeton Wordnet (Fell-baum, 1998) in terms of sets of synonymous words or so-called synsets between which basic semantic relations ale expressed The synsets are based on the lexicalizations and expressions in each language Each wordnet therefoie can be seen as a unique language-specific stiucture In addition to the ielations between synsets there is also a relation to a so-called Inter-Lingual-Index This Inter-Lingual-Index (ILI) is an unstructuied fund of concepts, so-called ILI-records, with the sole purpose of linking synsets across languages Synsets that are linked to the same ILI-record can be said to be equivalent across two languages By means of the ILI it is thus possible to go from one wordnet to the other and to compare the lexicalization patterns across languages The characteristics of the ILI are defined by its function to provide an efficient mapping acioss the meanings in the wordnets for the different languages Two major requirements follow from this",

        "• It has a higher computational cost (at indexing time) to map documents Into the ILI",
        "We have conducted some experiments to test a) how different WSD strategies affect precision/recall figures, and b) how ILI clustering may affect indexing and retrieval performance We have used a variation on the IR-SEMCOR test collection described in (Gonzalo et al. , 1998) This test collection, adapted from Semcor, is small for current IR standards (3Mb excluding all tags, slightly bigger than the standard TIME collection), but is fully semantically tagged This feature permits comparing the performance of manual versus automatic sense disambiguation / sense filtering The set of queries is available and hand-tagged in English and Spanish, permitting monolingual and Cross-Language (Spanish to English) retrieval The results are shown for a number of different indexations of the IR-SEMCOR collection, with and ithout using the actual ILI clusters There are three full disambiguation strategies in which evely noun term Is represented as a single synset The rest are sense filtering strategies that return the list of mote likely synsets for every noun term Words other than nouns are left unchanged The disambiguation strategies aie Manual ietuins synset assigned by IR-SENICOR tags First sense Returns First sense in Wordnet 1 5 (not applicable on Spanish queries), AR (Agnre-Rigau) An implementation of the Agirie-Rigau WSD algorithm (Agirre and Rigau, 1996), that has the advantages of a) being unsupervised and b) being applicable on any language, provided there is a WordNet for it This algorithm gives a weighting for the candidate senses, rather than just picking one of them and discarding the rest In the experiment se take all the senses with maximal weight Its WSD performance is lower than the Fast Sense heuristic, especially disambiguating queries, as the disambiguation context is much smaller, No WSD A noun term is represented with all its possible synsets, Manual queries Combines the No WSD strategy for documents and the Manual strategy for queries This is a plausible combination of efficient document indexing (no disambiguation is required) with interactive retrieval (user-assisted disambiguation) Table 4 shows how the ILI clusterings reduce ambiguity in the representation of the documents for each of the indexing strategies The first column in the table shows the number of clustered occurrences of noun synsets against the total number of noun synsets The second column shows the number of reductions performed on ambiguous terms (that is on terms that are not fully disambiguated and ate thus represented as a list of synsets) One 'eduction means, e g that a word represented as n different ss nsets is now represented as n – 1 different sy nsets The number of clustered sy nsets is quite high, gil en the small size of ILI noun clusters In paiticu-lar the ambiguity reduction is ery promising with 49074 reductions in 65737 polysemous tetins in the collection The reason is that clustets are mostly applied on highly poly semous words, w Inch are in tuin the most frequently used The results of the monolingual and ctoss-language IR expeiiments can be seen in Table 3 The results ithout clusterings are in the first row and with clustering in the second row The figures represent the average precision at ten fixed recall points between 10 and 100 We have used the INQUERY system (Callan et al. , 1992) to perform the experiments The results suggest",
        "• There is a potential improvement over standard INQUERY runs as shown by the results on",
        "the manually disambiguated collections The Cross-Language track is especially promising, with a gain of 34 5% over the standard technique (translation of the query using POS tagging and bilingual dictionary expansion)",
        "• Although the Agirre-Rigau algorithm performs",
        "much worse than the First Sense heuristic in terms of WSD accuracy, it gives slightly better results for IR, as it just filters the most unlikely senses This is experimental evidence in favor of evaluating WSD algorithms within concrete tasks, in addition to general-purpose evaluations such as the SENSEVAL one • The last column (' manual queries\") corresponds to expansion to all synsets in the documents (no disambiguation) and manual disambiguation of the query This method improves Cioss-Language Retrieval by 30% (comparable to full manual indexing), and degrades only 79 from monolingual to bilingual retrieval (standard degradation is 30-60(7c) This suggests that EWN can be very useful in interacti• e ,-etrieval settings (where the user is guided through a disambiguation process) even if the database has not been disambiguated at all • The results using the ILI clusters are similar or slightly worse than without clustering A possible reason is that the ILI clusters and the clusters needed for IR do not exactly match It would be probably beneficial to further distinguish types of clustering according to their ability to identify co-occurring senses of a word, in a similar vein to Buitelaar's white and black dot operators (Buitelaar, 1998) These operators distinguish related senses that tend to co-occui simultaneously (such as book as wiztten work oi physical object) and related senses that occur in different contexts (such as gate as movable barrier or computer circuit) Obuously, the first ones are optimal candidates for clustering in Information Retrie%al applications A more refined typology of ILI clusterings in general, seems required to use different clustering types for different tasks"
