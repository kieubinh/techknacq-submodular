        "While bilingual text corpora have been part of the computational linguistics scene for over ten years now, we have recently witnessed the appearance of text corpora containing versions of texts in three or more languages, such as those developed within the CRATER (McEnery et al., 1997), MULTEXT (Ide and Veronis, 1994) and MULTEXT-EAST (Erjavec and Ide, 1998) projects.",
        "Access to this type of corpora raises a number of questions: Do they make new applications possible?",
        "Can methods developed for handling bilingual texts be applied to multilingual texts?",
        "More generally: is there anything to gain in viewing multilingual documents as more than just multiple pairs of translations?",
        "Bilingual alignments have so far shown that they can play multiple roles in a wide range of linguistic applications, such as computer assisted translation (Isabelle et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1990), terminology (Dagan and Chureh, 1994) lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Melamed, 1996), and cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al., \" This research was funded by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/), via the Agence de La francophonie (http://www.francophonie.org) 1998).",
        "However, the case for trilingual and multilingual alignments is not as clear.",
        "True multilingual resources such as multilingual glossaries are not widely used, and most of the time, when such resources exist, the real purpose is usually to provide bilingual resources for multiple pairs of languages in a compact way.",
        "What we intend to show here is that while multilingual correspondences may not be interesting in themselves, multilingual text alignment techniques can be useful as a means of extracting information on bilingual correspondences.",
        "Our idea is that each additional version of a text should be viewed as valuable information that can be used to produce better alignments.",
        "In other words: whatever the intended application, three languages are better than two (and, more generally: the more languages, the merrier!).",
        "After going through some definitions and preliminary material (Section 1), we present a general method for aligning three versions of a text (Section 2).",
        "We then describe some experiments that were carried out to evaluate this approach (Section 3) and various possible optimizations (Section 4).",
        "Finally, we report on some disturbing experiments (Section 5), and conclude with directions for future work."

        "There are various ways in which the concept of alignment can be formalized.",
        "Here, we choose to view alignments as mathematical relations between linguistic entities: Given two texts, A and B, seen as sets of linguistic units: A = {al, a2, am} and B = {b1,b2, ...,bn} , we define a binary alignment XAB as a relation on A U B:",
        "The interpretation of XAB is: (a, b) belongs to XAB if and only if some translation equivalence exists between a and b, total or partial.",
        "This definition of alignment, inspired from Kay and Rnscheisen (1993), can be naturally extended to accommodate any number of versions of a text.",
        "In general, we will say that, given N versions of a text A1, ..., AN, a N-lingual alignment XA7 is a relation on UlAi.",
        "Clearly, a N-lingual alignment can be obtained by combining pairwise bilingual alignments.",
        "For example, with three texts A, B and C, and three alignments XAB, XBG, and XcA, one can easily obtain the trilingual alignment XABG, as XAB U XBc U XcA.",
        "In fact, in all that follows, we indifferently refer to trilingual alignments as unique relations or as triples of bilingual alignments.",
        "Conversely, any smaller-degree alignment can be extracted as a subset of a N-lingual alignment, by projecting the relation onto a given \"plane\".",
        "Another thing that becomes apparent as soon as more than two languages are involved is that text-translation alignments appear to be equivalence relations, which means that they generally display the properties of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity:",
        "• reflexivity: Any word or sequence of words aligns with itself – which is natural,",
        "insofar as we extend the notion of \"translation\", so as to include the translation from one language to itself...",
        "• symmetry: if a in language A is aligned with b in language B, then we expect b to align with a.",
        "In other words, alignment is not \"directional\".",
        "• transitivity: if a aligns with b, and if b itself aligns with c, then a aligns with c.",
        "Although there are limits to the applicability of these mathematical properties to real-life translations, the case of transitivity is particularly interesting, as we will see later on.",
        "Translation equivalences can be viewed at different levels of resolution, from the level of documents to those of structural divisions (chapters, sections, etc.",
        "), paragraphs, sentences, words, morphemes and eventually, characters.",
        "In general, it seems quite clear that the smaller the units, the more interesting an alignment is likely to be (although we can question the interest of a character-level alignment).",
        "However, in the experiments described here, we focus on alignment at the level of sentences, this for a number of reasons: First, sentence alignments have so far proven their usefulness in a number of applications, e.g. bilingual lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), automatic translation verification (Macklovitch, 1995; Macklovitch, 1996) and the automatic acquisition of knowledge about translation (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Also, the sentence alignment problem has been widely studied, and we could even say that at this point in time, a certain consensus exists regarding how the problem should be approached.",
        "On the other hand, not only is the computation of finer-resolution alignments, such as phrase or word-level alignments, a much more complex operation, it also raises a number of difficult problems related to evaluation (Melamed, 1998), which we wanted to avoid, at least at this point.",
        "Finally, we believe that the concepts, methods and results discussed here can be applied just as well to alignments at other levels of resolution."

        "It is therefore always possible to represent a non-crossing alignment as an equivalence relation.",
        "However, the converse is not true: in particular, and as their name suggests, one cannot explicitly represent inversions with such alignments, i.e. situations where the order of sentences is not preserved across translation.",
        "In spite of this limitation, these alignments cover the vast majority of situations encountered in real-life texts, at least at the level of sentences (Gale and Church, 1991).",
        "There is a problem with extending this class of alignment algorithms to deal with the general N-dimensional case, however: the computational complexity of the algorithm increases multiplicatively with each new language.",
        "For instance, the space and time complexity of the trilingual version of the Gale and Church (1991) program would be O(N3).",
        "The use of such an algorithm quickly becomes prohibitive (for example: 1,000,000 computation steps for texts of 100 sentences each).",
        "Of course, in the case of bilingual alignment, it is common practice to restrict the search, for instance to a narrow corridor along the main \"diagonal\" (see Simard and Plamondon (1998), for example).",
        "But even with such heuristics, it is quite clear that in general, the search-space will grow multiplicatively with each new language.",
        "Nevertheless, the idea of aligning multiple versions of a text simultaneously is intuitively appealing: while the alignment operation will no doubt be more complex than with two languages, every new version brings some additional information, which we should be able to make good use of (see Figure 2).",
        "Therefore, we will want to find a way to overcome the complexity issues.",
        "We know that the multilingual alignment problem is related to a number of other sequence Figure 2: Three texts are easier to align than two - In the face of an uncertainty regarding correspondences between b2, c1 and c2: the absence of evidence for (a2, ci) or (al, b2) correspondences suggests rejecting (b2, ci), while a similar reasoning supports (b2, c2).",
        "comparison problems, with applications in various domains.",
        "In particular, molecular biologists are concerned with relating sequences of nucleotides (in DNA or RNA molecules) and of amino acids (in proteins) (Sternberg, 1996).",
        "The methods used to attack these problems are very similar to those used in translation alignment, and rely largely on dynamic programming In practice, researchers in molecular biology have observed that, insofar as the input sequences are not excessively dissimilar, the greater the number of sequences, the better the alignments obtained.",
        "Therefore, numerous strategies have been proposed to alleviate the complexity issues related to multiple sequence comparison (Chan et al., 1992).",
        "One common heuristic approach is to reduce the search-space, either in width (i.e. by concentrating the search around the \"diagonal\"), or in depth (i.e. by",
        "first segmenting the input sequences at judicious points, and then aligning the subsequences).",
        "Of course, these strategies are also widely used in text-translation alignment.",
        "However, the most widespread approach is to construct multiple alignments by iteratively combining smaller-degree alignments.",
        "While these methods are not generally optimal, they still produce good results in most situations.",
        "More importantly, for a given number of sequences, they usually work in quadratic time and space.",
        "The general idea is to first compare sequences two-by-two, so as to measure their pairwise similarity; based on the result of this operation, an order of alignment is determined – typically, the most similar pairs will be aligned first; the final multiple alignment is produced by gradually combining alignments (see, for example, Barton and Sternberg (1987)).",
        "This approach can be directly adapted to the trilingual text alignment problem.",
        "The idea is simple: given three versions of a text A, B and C, in three different languages, we first determine which of the three pairs AB, BC or AC is the most \"similar\".",
        "Let us suppose that this is the AB pair.",
        "We then align this pair, using whatever bilingual alignment program we have at hand, producing XAB; we then align text C with this alignment, thus producing XABC.",
        "To implement this idea, we need to answer two questions: First, how to measure the similarity between different versions of a text?",
        "And second, what does it mean to align a text with an alignment?",
        "There are certainly numerous possible answers to the first question.",
        "But actually, statistical alignment methods such as those derived from Gale and Church (1991) provide us with a simple solution: to find the best alignment, these methods explore different alignment hypotheses, and select the one with the highest probability with regard to a certain statistical model of translation.",
        "Therefore, at the end of the operation, a statistical alignment program has at its disposal an overall score for the best alignment, in the form of a global probability.",
        "In practice, we observe that this score is a good indicator of the similarity between two texts.",
        "For instance, Gale and Church used this score to identify dubious regions in their alignmentsl.",
        "lAlso recall that the dynamic programming approach Therefore, to determine the most similar pair of texts, we propose to compute the bilingual alignments XAB, XBc and XAc; and to compare the final alignment scores.",
        "Of course, for this exercise to be meaningful, we must make sure that the scores associated with the bilingual alignments are indeed comparable.",
        "In general, if the same alignment method is used with comparable translation models for all pairs of languages, this should not be a problem.",
        "Once the most similar pair of versions has been identified, say A and B, and we have computed a bilingual alignment for that pair, we are ready to tackle the problem of aligning the remaining text C with the XAB alignment.",
        "In practice, this will amount to aligning the elements of C (in our case, sentences) with individual \"couples\" of the XAB relation: whenever we align some sentence c E C with a sentence a E A, then this implies that c must also be aligned with all other sentences to which a is related within the transitive closure of XAB.",
        "In other words, this alignment method is \"inherently transitive\".",
        "In practice, the alignment of XAB and C is dealt with just like a bilingual alignment: the XAB alignment is viewed as a sequence of items, and dynamic programming is used to find the best alignment with the sentences of C. The only real difference lies in how individual \"triples\" are scored.",
        "Here again, we turn to molecular biology, where experience seems to show that the \"joint similarity\" of multiple items can be measured as the linear combination of all pairwise comparisons:",
        "This sort of combination supposes that all binary scoring functions s (as, a3) are comparable (Carillo and Lipman, 1988).",
        "Once again, this will not be a problem if we plan to use analogous translation models for all language pairs.",

        "Obtain the final trilingual alignment as the union of all partial alignments XABC =",
        "Once again, and as in the trial and trial++ methods, we finish up with a final bilingual alignment pass to compensate for \"transitivity noise\".",
        "This new program was succesful in aligning The Gospel According to John , using amounts of time and memory comparable to the trial++ program.",
        "However, the resulting alignments were quite different, as can be seen in the performance figures in Table 4.",
        "The performance of this new program on The Gospel According to John turns out to be not only poorer than that of the trial program, but also poorer than that of the sfial program!",
        "What is going on, here?",
        "After all, we would expect trial to be The optimal method, of which all others are heuristic approximations.",
        "Although we have no definitive answer to this question, we see two different lines of explanation.",
        "The first and most obvious possibility is that our initial assumption, namely that three languages are better than two, is false.",
        "In other words: aligning three texts is at least as hard as aligning two, and possibly harder.",
        "Of course, this would also imply that the results obtained with the trial and trial++ methods were mere accidents.",
        "Although this explanation for the failure of the trial approach clearly contradicts our initial intuitions, we cannot entirely reject it.",
        "We do not, however, pursue this line any further.",
        "(Besides, it doesn't go any further!)",
        "The second line of explanation leads us straight to the scoring function of our alignment methods.",
        "As in the trial and trial++ methods, the scoring function used in trial is the sum of all pairwise (bilingual) alignment scores.",
        "It could simply be that this way of measuring \"trilingual fit\" is inadequate.",
        "However, we believe that our problems run deeper.",
        "To begin with, it could be argued that what a trilingual alignment program really needs is a true \"trilingual translation mod-el\"; it is not at all clear that three bilingual translation models are an adequate substitute for this.",
        "Even if it were, we know that there are numerous problems with the \"length\" and \"cognate\" stochastic models on which the sfial scoring function is based.",
        "For instance, we know that while these models usually describe the phenomena observed in translations adequately, they are not necessarily as good when it comes to things that are not translations.",
        "While these weaknesses do not appear to cause too many problems when computing bilingual alignments, it would not be surprising that a third language is all it takes for incoherences to creep out and performance to degrade.",
        "If this is indeed the case, then this is one more argument in favor of the trial approach: by treating multilingual alignments the same way as bilingual alignments, this approach may let us get away with poor translation models, at least until we come up with something better!"

        "In experiments on English, French and Spanish versions of The Gospel According to John, this approach produced sentence alignments significantly better than those obtained using a bilingual alignment program.",
        "All tests reported here were conducted on a single, relatively small corpus of text.",
        "The contradictory results reported in Section 5 highlight the need for more work with regard to evaluation.",
        "Such an evaluation exercise would normally imply putting together a much larger and more varied test corpus, segmented and aligned by hand, a process which is known to be costly.",
        "However, since the goal is to measure improvements relative to existing bilingual alignment methods, an interesting alternative would be to perform a relative evaluation instead: the programs could then be tested on a much larger test-corpus, and the performance of each system would be measured on only those portions of text where the alignments differ.",
        "The details of such an evaluation need to be worked out.",
        "Also, it remains to be seen how the trial approach would adapt to the general multilingual case (three languages or more) on the one hand, and to the more challenging problem of finer-grained alignments on the other hand.",
        "Here again, we will likely encounter numerous complications, most notably regarding questions of evaluation.",
        "Ongoing work in the word-alignment track of the ARCADE project is likely to bring interesting results regarding this question (Langlais et al., 1998).",
        "Finally, and probably more importantly, working with more than two languages has highlighted weaknesses in the modeling of translation that underlies our alignment methods.",
        "Much work remains to be done in this direction."
