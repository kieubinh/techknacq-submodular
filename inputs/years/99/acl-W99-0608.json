        "The study of general methods to improve the performance in classification tasks, by the combination of different individual classifiers, is a currently very active area of research in supervised learning.",
        "In the machine learning (ML) literature this approach is known as ensemble, stacked, or combined classifiers.",
        "Given a classification problem, the main goal is to construct several independent classifiers, since it has been proven that when the errors committed by individual classifiers are uncorrelated to a sufficient degree, and their error rates are low enough, the resulting combined classifier performs better than all the individual systems (Ali and Pazzani, 1996; Turner and Ghosh, 1996; Dietterich, 1997).",
        "Several methods have been proposed in order to construct ensembles of classifiers that make uncorrelated errors.",
        "Some of them are general, and they can be applied to any learning algorithm, while other are specific to particular algorithms.",
        "From a different perspective, there exist methods for constructing homogeneous ensembles, in the sense that a unique learning algorithm has been used to acquire each individual classifier, and heterogeneous ensembles that combine different types of learning paradigmsl.",
        "Impressive results have been obtained by applying these techniques on the so – called unstable learning algorithms (e.g. induction of decision trees, neural networks, rule – induction systems, etc.).",
        "Several applications to real tasks have been performed, and, regarding NLP, we find ensembles of classifiers in context – sensitive spelling correction (Golding and Roth, 1999), text categorization (Schapire and Singer, 1998; Blum and Mitchell, 1998), and text filtering (Schapire et al., 1998).",
        "Combination of classifiers have also been applied to POS tagging.",
        "For instance, van Halteren (1996) combined a number of similar taggers by way of a straightforward majority vote.",
        "More recently, two parallel works (van Halteren et al., 1998; Brill and Wu, 1998) combined, with a remarkable success, the output of a set of four taggers based on different principles and feature modelling.",
        "Finally, in the work by Marquez et al.",
        "(1998) the combination of taggers is used in a bootstrapping algorithm to train a part of speech tagger from a limited amount of training material.",
        "The aim of the present work is to improve an existing POS tagger based on decision trees (Marquez and Rodriguez, 1997), by using ensembles of classifiers.",
        "This tagger treats separately the different types (classes) of ambiguity by considering a different decision tree for each class.",
        "This fact allows a selective construction of ensembles of decision trees focusing on the most relevant ambiguity classes, which greatly vary in size and difficulty.",
        "Another goal of the present work is to try to alleviate the problem of data sparseness by applying a method, due",
        "to Breiman (1998), for generating new pseudo – examples from existing data.",
        "As we will see in section 4.2 this technique will be combined with the construction of an ensemble of classifiers.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: we start by presenting the two versions of the POS tagger and their evaluation on the reference corpus (sections 2 and 3).",
        "Sections 4 and 5 are, respectively, devoted to present the machine – learning improvements and to test their implementation.",

        "Decision trees have been successfully applied to a number of different NLP problems and, in particular, in POS tagging they have proven to be an efficient and compact way of capturing the relevant information for disambiguating.",
        "See (Marquez, 1999) for a broad survey on this issue.",
        "In this approach to tagging, the ambiguous words in the training corpus are divided into classes corresponding to the sets of tags they can take (i.e, 'noun-adjective', 'noun-adjectiveverb', etc.).",
        "These sets are called ambiguity classes and a decision tree is acquired for each of them.",
        "Afterwards, the tree – base is applied in a particular disambiguation algorithm.",
        "Regarding the learning algorithm, we use a particular implementation of a top – down induction of decision trees (TDIDT) algorithm, belonging to the supervised learning family.",
        "This algorithm is quite similar to the well – known CART (Breiman et al., 1984), and C4.5 (Quin-lan, 1993), but it incorporates some particularities in order to better fit the domain at hand.",
        "Training examples are collected from annotated corpora and they consist of the target word to be disambiguated and some information of its local context in the sentence.",
        "All words not present in the training corpus are considered unknown.",
        "In principle, we have to assume that they can take any tag corresponding to open categories (i.e., noun, proper noun, verb, adjective, adverb, cardinal, etc.",
        "), which sum up to 20 in the Penn Treebank tagset.",
        "In this approach, an additional ambiguity class for unknown words is considered, and so, they are treated exactly in the same way as the other ambiguous words, except by the type of information used for acquiring the trees, which is enriched with a number of morphological features.",
        "Once the tree – model has been acquired, it can be used in many ways to disambiguate a real text.",

        "After that, an iterative process reduces the ambiguity (discarding low probable tags) at each step until a certain stopping criterion is satisfied.",
        "More particularly, at each step and for each ambiguous word (at a sentence level) the work performed in parallel is: 1) The target word is \"passed\" through its corresponding decision tree; 2) The resulting probability distribution is used to multiplicatively update the probability distribution of the word; and 3) The tags with very low probabilities are filtered out.",
        "For more details, we refer the reader to (Marquez and Rodriguez, 1997).",
        "2.2 STT: A Statistical Tree – based Tagger",
        "The aim of statistical or probabilistic tagging (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992) is to assign the most likely sequence of tags given the observed sequence of words.",
        "For doing so, two kinds of information are used: the lexical probabilities, i.e, the probability of a particular tag conditional on the particular word, and the contextual probabilities, which describe the probability of a particular tag conditional on the surrounding tags.",
        "Contextual (or transition) probabilities are usually reduced to the conditioning of the preceding tag (bigrams), or pair of tags (trigrams), however, the general formulation allows a broader definition of context.",
        "In this way, the set of acquired statistical decision trees can be seen as a compact representation of a rich contextual model, which can be straightforwardly incorporated inside a statistical tagger.",
        "The point here is that the context is not restricted to the n-1 preceding tags as in the n – gram formulation.",
        "Instead, it is extended to all the contex",
        "tual information used for learning the decision trees.",
        "The Viterbi algorithm (described for instance in (DeRose, 1988)), in which n-gram probabilities are substituted by the application of the corresponding decision trees, allows the calculation of the most-likely sequence of tags with a linear cost on the sequence length.",
        "However, one problem appears when applying conditionings on the right context of the target word, since the disambiguation proceeds from left to right and, so, the right hand side words may be ambiguous.",
        "Although dynamic programming can be used to calculate the most likely sequence of tags to the right (in a forward-backward approach), we use a simpler approach which consists of calculating the contextual probabilities by a weighted average of all possible tags for the right context.",
        "Additionally, the already presented tagger allows a straightforward incorporation of n-gram probabilities, by linear interpolation, in a back-off approach including, from most general to most specific, unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and decision trees.",
        "From now on, we will refer to STT as STT+ when using n-gram information.",
        "Due to the high ambiguity of unknown words, their direct inclusion in the statistical tagger would result in a severe decreasing of performance.",
        "To avoid this situation, we apply the tree for unknown words in a pre-process for filtering low probable tags.",
        "In this way, when entering to the tagger the average number of tags per unknown word is reduced from 20 to 3.1."

        "We also think that other issues than simply 'accuracy rates' are becoming more important in order to test and evaluate the real utility of different approaches for tagging.",
        "Such aspects, that should be studied in the near future, refer to the ability of adapting to new domains (tuning), the types of errors committed and their influence on the task at hand, the language independence assumption, etc."
