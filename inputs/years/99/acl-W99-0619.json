        "The production of natural, intelligible speech remains a major challenge for speech synthesis research.",
        "Recent research has focused on prosody modeling (Silverman, 1987; Hirschberg, 1990; Santen, 1992), which determines the variations in pitch, tempo and rhythm One of the critical issues in prosody modeling is pitch accent assignment.",
        "Pitch accent is associated with the pitch prominence of a word.",
        "For example, some words may sound more prominent than others within a sentence because they are associated with a sharp pitch rise or fall.",
        "Usually, the prominent words bear pitch accents while the less prominent ones do not.",
        "Although native speakers of a particular language have no difficulty in deciding which words in their utterances should be accented, the general pattern of accenting in a language, such as English, is still an open question.",
        "Some linguists speculate that relative informativeness, or semantic weight of a word can influence accent placement.",
        "Ladd (1996) claims that \"the speakers assess the relative semantic weight or informativeness of potentially accentable words and put the accent on the most informative point or points\" (ibid, pg.",
        "175).",
        "He also claims that \"if we understand relative semantic weight, we will automatically understand accent placement\" (ibid, pg.",
        "186).",
        "Bolinger (Bolinger, 1972) also uses the following examples to illustrate the phenomenon:",
        "1.",
        "\"He was arrested because he KILLED a man.\" 2.",
        "\"He was arrested because he killed a POLICEMAN.\"",
        "The capitalized words in the examples are accented.",
        "In (1), \"man\" is semantically empty relative to \"kill\"; therefore, the verb \"kill\" gets accented.",
        "However, in (2), \"policeman\" is semantically rich and is accented instead.",
        "However, different theories, not based on informativeness, were proposed to explain the above phenomenon.",
        "For example, Bres-nan's (1971) explanation is based on syntactic function.",
        "She suggests that \"man\" in the above sentence does not get accented because \"man\" and other words like \"guy\" or \"person\" or \"thing\" form a category of",
        "\"semi-pronouns\" Counterexamples listed below raise more questions about the usefulness of semantic informativeness.",
        "The accent pattern in the following examples cannot be explained solely by semantic informativeness.",
        "3.",
        "\"HOOVER dam.\" 4.",
        "\"Hoover TOWER.\"",
        "While researchers have discussed the possible influence of semantic informativeness, there has been no known empirical study of the claim nor has this type of information been incorporated into computational models of prosody.",
        "In this work, we employ two measurements of informativeness.",
        "First, we adopt an information-based framework (Shannon, 1948), quantifying the \"Information Content (IC)\" of a word as the negative log likelihood of a word in a corpus.",
        "The second measurement is TF*IDF (Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency) (Salton, 1989; Salton, 1991), which has been widely used to quantify word importance in information retrieval tasks.",
        "Both IC and TF*IDF are well established measurements of informativeness and therefore, good candidates to investigate.",
        "Our empirical study shows that word informativeness not only is closely related to word accentuation, but also provides new power in pitch accent prediction.",
        "Our results suggest that information content is a valuable feature to be incorporated in speech synthesis systems.",
        "In the following sections, we first define IC and TF*IDF.",
        "Then, a description of the corpus used in this study is provided.",
        "We then describe a set of experiments conducted to study the relation between informativeness and pitch accent.",
        "We explain how machine learning techniques are used in the pitch accent modeling process.",
        "Our results show that:",
        "• Both IC and TF*IDF scores are strongly correlated with pitch accent assignment.",
        "• IC is a more powerful predictor than TF*IDF.",
