        "Statistical approaches to parsing have received a great deal of attention over recent years.",
        "The availability of large tagged and syntactically bracketed corpora make the programmatic extraction of lexica and grammars feasible.",
        "Researchers have tackled parsing by substituting these automatically derived resources for hand-coded ones.",
        "While these approaches have had some success to date (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a), their usability as parsers in systems for natural language understanding is suspect.",
        "The reconstruction of Treebank-style bracketings does not serve as an adequate basis for semantic interpretation.",
        "The phrase structure rules are too numerous, and the analyses too coarse (especially at the lower levels) to allow association of deterministic semantic rules with phrase structure rules.",
        "Charniak himself (1997b) notes that most of the parses constructed by a \"wide-coverage\" grammar are \"pretty senseless\".",
        "1Collins, Charniak, etc.",
        "make no claims about their programs being Well suited as parsers for language understanding applications.",
        "Certainly, this type of parsing has had success to-date in applications such as Information Retrieval.",
        "As an example, consider the flat NP structures that are in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Nouns, determiners, and adjectives are all sisters of each other in the syntactic annotation, e.g. (NP (DT the) (JJ mechanical) (NN engineering) (NN industry)).",
        "A parser which constructs structures such as this fails to solve an ambiguity problem that has generally been considered syntactic: Are we talking about the industry of mechanical engineering, or is the entire engineering industry perceived as mechanical?",
        "If our goal is language understanding, including semantic interpretation, the Treebank bracketings must be considered underspecified.",
        "We describe here a system which combines hand-coded linguistic resources with corpus-derived probabilistic information to enable (fairly) wide-coverage syntactic parsing.",
        "Most importantly, the use of these linguistic resources allows for a better-informed probabilistic model."

        "WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) provides the semantic information.",
        "In addition, we add to our lexicon approximately 47,000 \"multiword\" nouns found in WordNet.",
        "SAPIR, the parser we are using, employs a feature-based general grammar of English that has been in development at The Boeing Company over the past fifteen years (Harrison and Maxwell, 1986).",
        "The grammar consists of approximately 500 rules.",
        "By mapping COM-LEX's lexical entries into a format understandable by SAPIR, we have a general purpose, well-founded, English language parser.",
        "With such a parser, we can use Penn's Treebank the way it was probably intended: as a set",
        "of bracketing constraints for the syntactic analysis of a sentence.",
        "The Linguistic Data Consortium provides a preliminary version (1.075) of the Treebank's bracketing of the Brown Corpus (Kueera and Francis, 1967).",
        "Fortunately, SAPIR provides an interface whereby a sentence and a partially specified parse tree can be fed to the parser, so that only the syntactic analyses that conform with the provided bracketing will be pursued.",
        "So it is with this mechanism that we create our corpus.",
        "We start with the bracketed (but not part-of-speech â€“ tagged) version of the Treebank, and process the bracketings in several ways, most notably removing quotation marks and \"assuaging\" gaps.",
        "The latter consists primarily of identifying the Treebank's sentential constructs which are considered verb phrases by SAPIR, and making that transformation.",
        "For example, a Treebank tree like (PP in (S (NP *) (VP going (NP home) ) ) ) would be mapped to (PP in (VP going (NP home) ) ).",
        "Since this bracketing is supplied to SAPIR as a constraint, the parser is free to construct the gerundive NP containing solely the VP.",
        "In fact, the bracketing corresponding to the parse found by SAPIR is:",
        "(Note that postfix indicates a one-bar level phrase, as per 5Z-theory (Jackendoff, 1977).)",
        "Approximately 30% of the Treebank bracketings are parseable, after this assuagement, by our parser.",
        "These 30% comprise our corpus.",
        "Of course, each (parseable) bracketing does not always yield just one parse.",
        "SAPIR has some hand-coded costs on syntactic rules which have served as its preference mechanism to-date.",
        "When SAPIR finds more than one parse for a given bracketing, we simply choose its most preferred one to use in our corpus.",
        "While we certainly do not feel that this is the best way to create our corpus, we would like to note that over 25% of the parseable bracketings yield a unique parse, and over 50% have just one or two possible parses.",
        "We should also note that the parseable bracketings are, of course, shorter (on average) than the unparseable ones.",

        "To this end, we propose a generative model which is a direct extension of a Probabilistic Context Free Grammar (PCFG).",
        "In our model, as in a PCFG, the sentence is generated via top-down expansion of its parse tree, beginning with the root node.",
        "The crucial difference, however, is that as we expand from a nonterminal to its children, we simultaneously generate both the syntactic category and the head word of each child.",
        "This expansion is predicated on the category and head word of the mother.",
        "We will also make the traditional assumption that all sentences are generated independently of each other.",
        "Then, under this assumption and the assumed model, we can write the probability of a particular parse tree T as the product of all its expansions, or",

        "(Of course, all of these terms should be indexed appropriately for the expansion under consideration, but we leave that off for clarity.)",

        "Also note that each tree is assumed to be rooted at a dummy UTT node (with a dummy WORD head word), which serves as the parent for the \"true root\" of the tree.",
        "We can expand (1) via the chain rule:",
        "Note we have dropped 17 from the equations, since as noted above, that sequence is determined by rulename and X.",
        "This is an appealing",
        "rewriting, since the first term of (2), which we will term the syntactic expansion probability, corresponds neatly to the theory of Lexical Preference for those rules whose head constituent is a lexical category.",

        "(1982)",
        "(1) a. Mary wanted the dress on that rack b. Mary positioned the dress on that rack",
        "LP predicts that the preferred interpretation for the first sentence, is the (NI, the dress on that rack) structure, while for the second, a reader would prefer the flat V-NP-PP structure.",
        "This follows from the theory of Lexical Preference, which stipulates that the head word of a phrase selects for its \"most preferred\" syntactic expansion.",
        "This is exactly what is modeled by the first term of Equation (2).",
        "\"Lexical preference\" has been around a long time, and the (corresponding) syntactic expansion probability we use has been used by many researchers in parsing, including many of those mentioned in this article.",
        "The difficulty with this model, and perhaps the reason it has not been pursued to-date, is the intense data sparsity problem encountered in estimating the second term of equation (2), the lexical introduction probability.",
        "Much work in statistical parsing limits all probabilities to \"binary\" lexical statistics, where for any probability of the form I Y1,..., Yu), at most one of the X random variables and one of the Y random variables is lexical.",
        "By allowing \"n-ary\" lexical statistics, we allow an explosion of the probability space.",
        "Nevertheless, we suggest that human parsing is responsive to the familiarity (or otherwise) of particular head patterns in rules.",
        "To combat the data sparsity, we have used WordNet to \"back off\" to more general semantic classes when statistics on a word are unavailable.",
        "To back off semantically, however, we need to be dealing with word senses, not just word forms.",
        "It is a simple refinement of our model to replace all instances of \"head word\" with \"head sense\".",
        "Additionally, a semantic concordance of a subset of the Brown Corpus and WordNet senses is available (Landes et al., 1998).",
        "Thus, our corpus, collected as described in Section 2, can be augmented to use statistics on word senses in syntactic constructs, after alignment of this semantic concordance (of Brown) with treebank's labeled bracketing (of Brown).",
        "Moreover, a language model that distinguishes word senses will tend to reflect the semantic as well as syntactic and lexical patterns in language, and thus should be advantageous both in training the model and in using it for parsing."
