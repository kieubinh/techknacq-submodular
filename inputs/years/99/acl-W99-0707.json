        "It includes discovering the main constituents of sentences (NPs, VPs, PPs) and their heads, and determining syntactic relationships like subject, object, adjunct relations between verbs and heads of other constituents.",
        "Memory-Based Learning (MBL) shares with other statistical and learning techniques the advantages of avoiding the need for manual definition of patterns (common practice is to use hand-crafted regular expressions), and of being reusable for different corpora and sublanguages.",
        "The unique property of memory-based approaches which sets them apart from other learning methods is the fact that they are lazy /earners: they keep all training data available for extrapolation.",
        "All other statistical and machine learning methods are eager (or greedy) learners: They abstract knowledge structures or probability distributions from the training data, forget the individual training instances, and extrapolate from the induced structures.",
        "Lazy learning techniques have been shown to achieve higher accuracy than eager methods for many language processing tasks.",
        "A reason for this is the intricate interaction between regularities, subregularities and exceptions in most language data.",
        "and the related problem for learners of distinguishing noise from exceptions.",
        "Eager learning techniques abstract from what they consider noise (hapaxes, low-frequency events, non-typical events) whereas lazy learning techniques keep all data available, including exceptions which may sometimes be productive.",
        "For a detailed analysis of this issue, see [Daelemans et a/.. 1999a].",
        "Moreover, the automatic feature weighting in the similarity metric of a memory-based learner.",
        "makes the approach well-suited for domains with large numbers of features from heterogeneous sources, as it embodies a smoothing-by-similarity method when data is sparse [Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997].",
        "In this paper, we will provide a empirical evaluation of the NIBL approach to syntactic analysis on a number of shallow pattern learning tasks: NP chunking, VP chunking, and the assignment of subject-verb and object-verb relations.",
        "The approach is evaluated by cross-validation on the WSJ treebank corpus [Marcus et al., 1993].",
        "We compare the approach qualitatively and as far as possible quantitatively with other approaches."

        "F1 scores are 93.8% for NP chunking, 94.7% for VP chunking, 77.1% for subject detection and 79.0% for object detection.",
        "The accuracy and efficiency of the approach are encouraging (no optimisation or post-processing of any kind was used yet), and comparable to or better than state-of-the-art alternative learning methods.",
        "We also extensively compared our approach to a recently proposed new memory-based learning algorithm, memory-based sequence learning (MBSL, [Argamon et al., 1998] and showed that MBL, which is a computationally simpler algorithm than MBSL, is able to reach similar precision and recall when restricted to the MBSL definition of the NP chunking, subject detection and object detection tasks.",
        "More importantly, MBL is more flexible in the definition of the shallow parsing-tasks: it allows nested relations to be detected; it allows the addition and integration into the task of various additional sources of information apart from POS tags; it can segment a tagged sentence into different types of constituent chunks in one pass; it can scan a chunked sentence for different relation types in one pass (though separating subject-verb detection from object-verb detection is surely an option that must be investigated).",
        "In current research we are extending the approach to other types of constituent chunks and other types of syntactic relations.",
        "Combined with previous results on PP-attachment [Zavrel et al., 1997], the results presented here will be integrated into a complete shallow parser."
