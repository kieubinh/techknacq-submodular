        "In this paper, we describe work in progress on a corpus-based grammar tutor.",
        "The inspiration comes from the authors' extensive experience of teaching traditional and formal grammar to students specialising in computational linguistics and language engineering or – to use the terminology adopted for this workshop – Language and Speech Technology (LST).",
        "This practical teaching experience, from both elementary and advanced university courses, provided the original impetus to undertake the work described here.",
        "In particular, we were motivated by the following considerations.",
        "We wished: • to raise the generally poor level of grammar skills in our students, in an economic reality where the resources to provide individual instruction are conspicuously lacking;",
        "• to base the grammar learning on realistic data, both as to the kind of language analysed and as to the formalism used; • to separate for didactical purposes two conceptually, but not practically, independent components of a natural language grammatical description, viz, grammar and lexicon, without reducing either component to triviality; • to go from the simple to the complex in terms of the expressiveness of the formalism; • to support a hypothetico-deductive learning style \"learning by inquiry\" (McArthur et al.",
        "1995) based on intrinsic feedback (Laurillard 1996)."

        "Grammar, which used to play a leading role in teaching and learning languages, has been relegated to a fairly subordinate position in contemporary language pedagogy.",
        "Instead, language learning theorists currently favour so-called communicative approaches to language teaching.",
        "While it is true that most researchers in the field of second language learning (e.g. Ellis 1985; Light-bown and Spada 1993) recognise learning situations and learner types for which grammar may prove the most effective means of learning at least some aspects of a second or foreign language (see, e.g., Batstone 1994), even here it is not always explicit grammatical reasoning that the authors have in mind (see Underwood 1984).",
        "Theoretical insight in grammar is, on the whole, not regarded as very useful for language learners.",
        "We do not wish to take issue with the standpoint that foreign or second languages in general are better learned through conversational interaction than through the study of grammar.",
        "It is however obvious that the subject (both morphology and syntax) is a matter of vital importance for LST (and linguistics) students.",
        "They consequently need a solid grasp of the fundamental grammatical and lexicological concepts and the ability to apply them to the analysis of texts.",
        "They also need to be able to use grammar formalisms to state general grammatical principles.",
        "From our point of view, the ideological shift in language pedagogy has brought with it the unfortunate consequence that the students who enroll on our courses generally know less grammar than used to be the case.",
        "This in turn has forced our department to restructure both the language engineering and general linguistics curricula, through the addition of courses covering elementary grammatical concepts and techniques, knowledge of which we earlier could take for granted in our students.",
        "Grammatical analysis is a skill which – like many other skills – is best acquired and honed through its application to concrete reality, e.g. to words and sentences as found in authentic contexts, and by ,writing grammatical descriptions of (fragments of) natural language.",
        "At the same time, practical exercise sessions with a tutor are among the more costly modes of teaching.",
        "This is a pedagogical problem in times when many educational institutions experience financial cutbacks and the number of teacher hours per student decrease.",
        "Much would thus be gained if we could offer the students good self-study materials for grammar practice, good in the sense that they would be pedagogically sound, but also in the sense that they actually would be used by the students.",
        "Because of this, we are interested in investigating how computer-based grammar instruction material should be designed.",
        "For theoretical inspiration we have turned to the findings of the research in Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL).",
        "The reasons for this is that both CALL and our present aims are about computer-based language-related training and that CALL is a large and groWing research area.1 And, indeed, as we will se below, many of the insights of the CALL community seem to be directly relevant to the case at hand."

        "1997; see also Rogers 1998).",
        "In most cases these systems only deal with grammars from an abstract point of view, without calling attention to the issue how well a grammar accounts for real language.",
        "These systems do however offer the students valuable facilities, e.g. allow them to evaluate a grammar by using it to parse arbitrary strings or for random generation.",
        "For our purposes, these systems are \"realistic\" in one sense, namely in that they let students express linguistic generalisations in formalisms which are similar to those actually used by language technologists.",
        "In another sense, however, systems of this kind are spiritually kindred to the \"intuitive\" method in generative grammar, rather than to the goals of language engineering.",
        "The issue of how relevant data is to be found and used is normally left out of the picture altogether.",
        "This is a major pedagogical defect as the step from understanding grammars as formal systems to understanding them as theories about existing language use is both crucial and intellectually demanding.",
        "It is our experience that this is one of the most difficult aspects of education in formal grammar.",
        "We consequently think that there is much to gain by the use of a tutoring system that helps the student to see how a grammar relates to a morphosyntactically annotated corpus.",

      "text": [
        "The use of a tagged corpus as a testing ground for fledgling formal grammar writers confers another advantage which is often absent from the systems referred to above.",
        "Since the aim of these systems is to train the students in writing syntactic or morphological rules, the lexicon is more often than not reduced to the absolute minimum – both in the number and in the complexity of entries – needed to illustrate how the syntactic or morphological rule system works.",
        "This is indeed a problem, but it can not be solved simply by urging the students to compile extensive lexicons.",
        "On the contrary, there is a clear pedagogical point to the separation of the grammar from the lexicon for training purposes.",
        "Generally, it is a good principle to present new material a little at a time, in conceptually coherent portions.",
        "Otherwise, the students may get confused, and as a consequence frustrated.",
        "In this case, you would like to offer them a ready-made lexicon which should be flexible enough to accommodate a number of grammar formalisms (a \"poly-theoretic\" lexicon).",
        "A morphosyntactically tagged corpus can be made to stand in for such a lexicon, at least in some respects; in addition to the purely linguistic information contained in it, there is also (implicit) information about frequencies of occurence in authentic language, about collocations, etc.",
        "Even if there is lexical information which will not, as a rule, be found even in a fairly richly annotated corpus (e.g. valency information and semantics), the information that you can find there still constitutes a vast improvement over the typical lexicons of grammar training systems.",
        "Conversely, the tagged corpus makes an excellent basis for exercises aiming at learning to identify the \"atoms\" of grammar, i.e. parts of speech and inflectional categories, in a realistic context.",
        "There are some tutoring systems for this purpose (e.g. Qiao 1996), including one (Mats 1999) that we have been trying out in our department recently.",

        "1997) to traditional human teaching in a controlled evaluation procedure, and reach the conclusion that the corpus-based computer-assisted method yields slightly better learning results.",
        "2.3 First things first It is a good pedagogical principle not only to divide that which is to be learned into manageable chunks, but also to proceed from simpler to more complex knowledge.",
        "Ideally, the tutoring program should impose exactly this ordering for those students that need it (see Laurillard 1996).",
        "The mor-phosyntacially annotated corpus puts at the stu-dents' disposal a \"lexicon\" which will tag along, as it were, as",
        "• they learn to identify not only which part of speech a certain text word is, but also which inflectional information should be associated with it; • their grammars evolve in terminal complex",
        "ity from simple phrase structure rules with atomic terminal categories, to unification-based grammars with feature structures encoding the full morphosyntactic information for each lexical unit; • their grammars evolve in nonterminal complexity, enabling them to analyse increasingly larger portions of the corpus.",
        "2.4 Learning by inquiry A corpus-based grammar tutor shares with corpus-based CALL in general the trait of being eminently suited for hypothetico-deductive, problem and data-driven learning (\"serendipity learning\"; cf. Flowerdew 1996, or \"learning by inquiry\"; see McArthur et al.",
        "1995).",

        "This exercise exists in a preliminary version (Mats 1999), which has been used at our department with encouraging results.",
