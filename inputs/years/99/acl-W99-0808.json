        "There are two traditional distinctions in higher education that are currently on a period of big debate.",
        "The first one concerns industrial training vs higher education objectives, the second one is related to the role of emerging technologies for distance learning, potentially blurring the until now clear separation between conventional universities and distance learning Institutions.",
        "Changes in both Education and Training contexts are moving closer their previously separate objectives.",
        "On one hand, there is much concern about bringing educational curricula more in line with vocational needs.",
        "In a variety of disciplines, higher education courses are becoming oriented to professionally recognized qualifications, adopting approaches to integrate practice in context.",
        "On the other hand, industrial organizations are looking for a more versatile way of building personal profiles to adapt individuals to the changing needs of their organizations.",
        "Thus, acquiring more general skill is been increasingly addressed for advanced training purposes.",
        "Distance learning Universities are operating since the seventies.",
        "Most of them were based on the industrial model characterized by the production of highly effective learning materials for independent study and the use of \"one-way\" media, such as print, video, radio or TV broadcasting.",
        "While in traditional education the cost of education depends on the number of students involved, this is not the case with the industrial distance education model.",
        "The cost depends on a fixed part for the preparation of materials with less investment in academic staff for tutoring tasks.",
        "A clear improvement of using new technology for this model has been the delivery of course materials through CD-ROM, and later on through the Internet.",
        "Computer-based materials can integrate presentations with simulations, problem solving tools, virtual laboratories and the like, to engage students in a process of active learning.",
        "More controversial is the embedding of human-human interactive technologies.",
        "It is an open challenge to find new ways of satisfying increasing interaction between students and tutors when staff resources remain scarce.",
        "Peer collaboration is an idea to explore, but as it is the case in many industrial organizations collaborative behavior does not happen spontaneously just because the technology is available, but rather is a shift of culture to be established.",
        "The virtual campus [1] is a metaphor currently deserving a lot of attention.",
        "It is sometimes presented as a bridge for conventional universities td extend their scope to reach distance learners, sometimes as an opportunity for distance learning institutions to provide an environment combining the strength of systematic teaehing with elaborated materials to support more ' efficiently distance study.",
        "But metaphors should be carefully contrasted with the demand side perspective to foresee whether technology-ba§ed distance teaching can succeed.",
        "For example, 'there is, despite the quite short history of desktop computer conferencing, some failed pilot experiences in real-time multipoint teleteaching.",
        "The cost of equipment was a well-known factor, but another very practical issue was often neglected: real distance students are in fact fully reluctant to participate regularly in synchronous events, with a fixed schedule.",
        "The existing technology has demonstrated to be powerful.",
        "Paying due regard to usability issues in order to realize its potential for learning purposes remains an open question.",
        "Over the last decade the European Commission has launched a variety of programs to encourage international partnership and cooperation in the field of education and training.",
        "Some of the programs aimed at analyzing the current situation to recommend future action.",
        "Others were projects strongly technology oriented to develop platforms and environments specially focused on distance and flexible learning.",
        "In addition, a set of pilot experiences and applications were also implemented.",
        "Within the SOCRATES framework [2], ACO*HUM [3] is a thematic network including a working group on Computational linguistics and language engineering.",
        "A plan for developing open distance learning pilot courses was proposed in cooperation with ELSNET [4], and finally a proposal including six pilots was launched in February 98.",
        "We have developed one of them, on the topic of Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) [5].",
        "This topic is especially well suited for a learning-by-doing web course.",
        "The Internet itself is the biggest IR testbed, and the web search engines are the most powerful applications of IR techniques.",
        "The students can be guided through on-line NLP software to manipulate, expand, translate queries, etc., and get first hand impressions on the utility of such processes.",
        "Next section discusses our approach while a detailed presentation is given in section three."

      "heading": "2 Approach and aims",
      "text": [
        "The approach for developing our project has been to capture the experience of designing materials from the distance teaching tradition, while embracing two principles of recent learning theories in the support of both education and training: (i) learning by doing, and (ii) situated learning.",
        "The first addresses how to acquire knowledge [6] and the latter highlights the ability to deploy knowledge in real world context [7].",
        "Some of the assumptions we consider follows: A first essential component of our approach is to provide structured access to a set of tools and learning resources, both internal and external to the site.",
        "In order to deploy the strategy of learning-by-doing, students are required to perform tasks for each main issue.",
        "These tasks are designed to encourage lots of practical work situating the learning experience as close to the real world as possible.",
        "A second component is to help the learner to be introduced in a professional community.",
        "In this respect we would pay special attention to establish for all actors (researchers, teachers, professionals and students) concrete ways to collaborate fruitfully in the evolution and updating of the product.",
        "This is a quite important aspect in an emerging field where changes come quite rapidly.",
        "A third component is to enable the learner or trainee to became engaged in a learning community, breaking the feeling of being isolated.",
        "Social support and participation improve learners' motivation: facilities for shared virtual spaces and personal communication would be included.",
        "and embedded in the design of the prototype, further testing with users, as well as the internal evaluation and dissemination plan.",
        "A fourth component relates to our strong endorsement of the role of collaboration.",
        "A culture of collaboration needs to be developed.",
        "To explore the potential of group learning we would provide means for developing collaborative activities using asynchronous technology.",
        "This would be applicable in contexts where stable small groups of learners could be organized.",
        "Based on the above argumentation the project aims are listed below:",
        "• To develop a computer-based course • addressing the topic of applying Natural Language resources and techniques to Information Retrieval or, to be more accurate, Text Retrieval, dealing with multilinguality issues.",
        "• providing or assembling Internet on-line resources that permit a practical experimentation of the issues considered in the course.",
        "Such facilities can be in-site software, including: Stemmers, Morphological Analysers, Part of Speech Taggers for different languages, Multilingual Lexical Databases, Cross-Language Mapping of Queries or external, public domain resources such as Internet Retrieval Engines, Machine Translation Systems, etc.",
        "• To design a structured web-based site • allowing single learning on-line mode, and asynchronous collaboration mode • offering guidelines to support independent learners • providing an interface to facilitate flexible access to the content matter and the rest of the tools and resources • To involve colleagues in contributing to current and further development of the prototype",
        "The remaining sections of the paper describe how the background ideas have been articulated"

        "The Homepage menu (see figure 1) offers General Information and Communication Services, and provide access to the contents of the course.",
