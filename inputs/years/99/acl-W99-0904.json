        "Development of electronic morphological resources has undergone several decades of research.",
        "The first morphological analyzers focussed on inflectional processes (inflection, for English, mainly covers verb conjugation, and number and gender variations).",
        "With the development of Information Retrieval, people have looked for ways to build simple analyzers which are able to recognize the stem of a given word (thus addressing both inflection and derivation').",
        "These analyzers are known as stemmers.",
        "Faced with the increasing demand for natural language processing tools for a variety of languages, people have searched for procedures to (semi-)automatically acquire morphological resources.",
        "On the one hand, we find work from the IR community aimed at building robust stemmers without much attention given to the morphological processes of a language.",
        "Most of this work relies on a list of affixes, usually built by the system developer, and a set of rules to stem words (Lovins, 1968; Porter, 1980).",
        "Some of these works fit within an unsupervised setting, (Hafer and Weiss, 1974; Adamson and Boreham, 1974) and to a certain extent (Jacquemin and Tzoukerman, 1997), but do not directly address the problem of learning morphological processes.",
        "On the other hand, some researchers from the computational linguistics community have developed techniques to learn affixes of a language and software to segment words according to the identified elements.",
        "The work described in (Daelemans et al., 1999) is a good example of this trend, based on a supervised",
        "learning approach.",
        "However, it is difficult in most of these studies to infer the underlying linguistic framework assumed.",
        "We present in this paper an unsupervised method to learn suffixation operations of a language from an inflectional lexicon.",
        "This method also leads to the development of a stemming procedure for the language under consideration.",
        "Section 2 presents the linguistic view we adopt on derivation.",
        "Section 3 describes the preliminary steps of our learning method and constitutes the core of our stemming procedure.",
        "Finally, section 4 describes the learning of suffixation operations.",
        "The derivational processes of a language allow speakers of that language to analyse and generate new words.",
        "Most recent linguistic theories view these processes as operations defined on words to produce words.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, a word can be represented as an element made of several independent layers (feature structures, for example, could be chosen for this representation.",
        "We do not want to focus on a particular formalism here, but rather to explain the model we will adopt).",
        "The different layers and the information they contain vary from one author to the other.",
        "We adopt here the layers used in (Fradin, 1994), as exemplified on the French noun table:",
        "where (G) corresponds to the graphemic form of the word, (F) to the phonological form, and (M), (SX) and (S) respectively contain morphological, syntactic and semantic information.",
        "A derivation process then operates on such a structure to produce a new structure.",
        "Each layer of the original structure is transformed via this operation.",
        "We can adopt the following probabilistic model to account for such a derivation process:",
        "where Op is a derivation process, OpG is the component of Op which operates on the graphemic layer, and w(G) is the graphemic layer associated to word The different layers can be divided up into three main dimensions, used in linguistic studies to identify and classify suffixes of a language: the formal dimension (corresponding to G and F), the morpho-syntactic dimension (M and SX), and the semantic dimension (5).",
        "The nature of the operation along these dimensions mainly depend on the language under consideration.",
        "For example, for Indo-European languages, for the formal dimension, a suffixation operation consists in the concatenation of a suffix to the original form.",
        "Morphographemic as well as phonological rules are then applied to turn the ideal form obtained via concatenation into a valid surface form.",
        "We focus in this article on concatenative languages, id est languages for which derivation corresponds, for the formal dimension, to a concatenation operation.",
        "We also restrict ourselves to the study of suffixes and suffixation.",
        "Nevertheless, the principles and methods we use can be extended to non-concatenative languages and prefixes.",
        "The aim of the current work is twofold.",
        "On the one hand we want to develop stemming procedures for Information Retrieval.",
        "On the other hand, we want to develop methods to assist lexicographers in the development of derivational lexicons.",
        "We posses inflectional lexicons for a variety of different languages, and we'll use these lexicons as input to our system.",
        "Furthermore, we are interested in making the method as language independent, as possible, which means that we will explore languages without a. priori knowledge2 and thus we wish to rely on an unsupervised learning framework.",
        "The probabilistic model above suggests that, in order to learn suffixation operations of a language, one should look at word pairs (WI , w9) of that language for which w2 derives from w1.",
        "In an unsupervised setting, such pairs are not directly accessible, and we .need to find ways to extract the information we are interested in from a set of pairs the words of which are not always related via derivation.",
        "The method we designed first builds, for a given language, relational families, which are an approximation of derivational families.",
        "These families 210 particular, it is interesting to avoid relying on suffix lists, which vary from one author to the other.",
        "are then used to produce pairs of words which are a first approximation of the pairs of related words.",

        "Note that the strings sl and/or s2 may be empty: they are both empty if the words wi and w2 differ only in their part of speech, in which case we speak about conversion.",

        "Since \"deplorable\" is an adjective and \"deploringly\" is an adverb, we can provide a more precise form for the pseudo-suffix pair, and write (able+AJ,ingly+AV) (where +AJ stands for adjective and +AV for adverb) with the following interpretation: we can go from an adjective (resp.",

        "This last parameter accounts for the fact that the pseudo-suffix pairs encountered frequently are associated to actual suffixation processes whereas the less frequent ones either are associated to irregular phenomena or are not valid.",
        "But, in order to design a procedure which can be applied on several languages, and to avoid missing too many valid pseudo-suffix pairs, we have set these two parameters in the following loose way: Definition 3: a suffix pair of a language L is a pseudo-suffix pair of L which occurs more than once in the set of word couples of L which are at least",
        "Remarks: • two words are at least k-similar if they are p-similar with p> k, • all the suffix pairs are not valid.",
        "The above definition provides a set of pseudo-suffix pairs which is approximately contains the set of valid pseudo-suffix pairs.",
        "Our purpose here is not to miss any valid pseudo-suffix pair, • the number of occurrences of a pseudo-suffix pair is set at 2, the minimal value one can think of, and which corresponds to our desire to remain language independent, • the choice of the value 5 for the similarity factor represents a good trade off between the notion of long words and the desire to be language independent.",
        "We believe anyway that a slight change in this parameter won't lead to a set of pseudo-suffix pairs significantly different from the one we have.",
