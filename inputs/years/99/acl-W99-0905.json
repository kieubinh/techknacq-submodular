        "Choosing the correct translation of a content word in context, referred to as \"translation disambiguation (of content word)\", is a key task in machine translation.",
        "It is also crucial in cross-language text processing including cross-language information retrieval and abstraction.",
        "Due to the recent availability of large text corpora, various statistical approaches have been tried including using 1) parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1990), (Brown et al., 1991), (Brown, 1997), 2) non-parallel bilingual corpora tagged with topic area (Yamabana et al., 1998) and 3) untagged mono-language corpora in the target language (Dagan and Itai, 1994), (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), (Kikui, 1998).",
        "A problem with the first two approaches is that it is not easy to obtain sufficiently large parallel or manually tagged corpora for the pair of languages targeted.",
        "Although the third approach eases the problem of preparing corpora, it suffers from a lack of useful information in the source language.",
        "For example, suppose the proper name, \"Dodgers\", provides good context to identify the usage of \"hit\" in the training corpus in English.",
        "If the translation of \"Dodgers\" rarely occurs in the target language corpora, it does not contribute to target word selection.",
        "The method presented in this paper solves this problem by choosing the target word that corresponds to the usage identified in the source language corpora.",
        "This method is totally unsupervised in the sense that it acquires disambiguation information from non-parallel bilingual corpora (preferably in the same domain) free from tagging.",
        "It combines two unsupervised disambiguation algorithms: one is the word sense disambiguation algorithm based on distributional clustering(Schuetze, 1997) and the other is the translation disambiguation algorithm using target language corpora(Kikui, 1998).",
        "For the given word in context, the former algorithm identifies its usage as one of several predefined usage classes derived by clustering a large amount of usages in the source language corpus.",
        "The latter algorithm is responsible for associating each usage class (i.e., cluster) with a target word that best expresses the usage.",
        "The following sections are organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we overview the entire method.",
        "The following two sections (i.e., Section 3 and 4) then introduce the two major components of the method including the two unsupervised disambiguation algorithms.",
