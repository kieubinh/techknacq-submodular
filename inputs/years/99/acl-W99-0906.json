        "Cryptanalysts also encounter unreadable documents, but they try to read them anyway.",
        "With patience, insight, and computer power, they often succeed.",
        "Archaeologists and linguists known as epigraphers apply analogous techniques to ancient documents.",
        "Their decipherment work can have many resources as input, not all of which will be present in a given case: (1) monolingual inscriptions, (2) accompanying pictures or diagrams, (3) bilingual inscriptions, (4) the historical record, (5) physical artifacts, (6) bilingual dictionaries, (7) informal grammars, etc.",
        "In this paper, we investigate computational approaches to deciphering unknown scripts, and report experimental results.",
        "We concentrate on the following case:",
        "• unfamiliar script • known language • minimal input (monolingual inscriptions only)",
        "This situation has arisen in many famous cases of decipherment – for example, in the Linear B documents from Crete (which turned out to be a \"non-Greek\" script for writing ancient Greek) and in the Mayan documents from Mesoamerica.",
        "Both of these cases lay unsolved until the latter half of the 20th century (Chadwick, 1958; Coe, 1993).",
        "In computational linguistic terms, this decipherment task is not really translation, but rather text-to-speech conversion.",
        "The goal of the decipherment is to \"make the text speak,\" after which it can be interpreted, translated, etc.",
        "Of course, even after an ancient document is phonetically rendered, it will still contain many unknown words and strange constructions.",
        "Making the text speak is therefore only the beginning of the story, but it is a crucial step.",
        "Unfortunately, current text-to-speech systems cannot be applied directly, because they require up front a clearly specified sound/writing connection.",
        "For example, a system designer may create a large pronunciation dictionary (for English or Chinese) or a set of manually constructed character-based pronunciation rules (for Spanish or Italian).",
        "But in decipherment, this connection is unknown!",

        "(Sproat, forthcoming) suggests the class of finite-state transducers as one candidate.",
        "This narrows things down significantly from the class of Turing machines, but not far enough for the direct application of known training algorithms.",

        "Another intriguing possibility is to do language identification at the same time as decipherment.",

        "Whether a document represents a given language could then be estimated quantitatively.",

        "Archaeologists have sometimes succeeded in such cases by leveraging bilingual documents and loan words from related languages.",
        "Only a truly optimistic cryptanalyst would believe that progress could be made even without these resources; but see (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 1999) for initial results on Arabic-English translation using only monolingual resources.",
        "Finally, we note that the application of source-channel models to the text-to-speech problem is promising.",
        "This kind of statistical modeling is prevalent in speech recognition, but ours is one of the few applications in speech synthesis.",
