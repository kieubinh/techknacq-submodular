        "(1) John broke the window.",
        "(2) The window broke.",
        "a syntactic analysis will represent the window as the verb’s direct object in the first sentence and its subject in the second but does not indicate that it plays the same underlying semantic role in both cases.",
        "Note that both sentences are in the active voice",
        "and that this alternation in subject between transitive and intransitive uses of the verb does not always occur; for example, in the sentences",

        "and even in transitive uses, the role of the verb’s direct object can differ: (6) The sergeant played taps.",
        "(7) The sergeant played a beat-up old bugle.",
        "Alternation in the syntactic realization of semantic arguments is widespread, affecting most English verbs in some way, and the patterns exhibited by specific verbs vary widely (Levin 1993).",
        "The syntactic annotation of the Penn Treebank makes it possible to identify the subjects and objects of verbs in sentences such as the above examples.",
        "While the treebank provides semantic function tags such as temporal and locative for certain constituents (generally syntactic adjuncts), it does not distinguish the different roles played by a verb’s grammatical subject or object in the above examples.",
        "Because the same verb used with the same syntactic subcategorization can assign different semantic roles, roles cannot be deterministically added to the treebank by an automatic conversion process with 100% accuracy.",
        "Our semantic-role annotation process begins with a rule-based automatic tagger, the output of which is then hand-corrected (see section 4 for details).",
        "The Proposition Bank aims to provide a broad-coverage hand-annotated corpus of such phenomena, enabling the development of better domain-independent language understanding systems and the quantitative study of how and why these syntactic alternations take place.",
        "We define a set of underlying semantic roles for each verb and annotate each occurrence in the text of the original Penn Treebank.",
        "Each verb’s roles are numbered, as in the following occurrences of the verb offer from our data:",

[Arg2 Subcontractors] will be offered [Arg1 a settlement] ... (wsj_0187)",
        "We believe that providing this level of semantic representation is important for applications including information extraction, question answering, and machine",
        "translation.",
        "Over the past decade, most work in the field of information extraction has shifted from complex rule-based systems designed to handle a wide variety of semantic phenomena, including quantification, anaphora, aspect, and modality (e.g., Alshawi 1992), to more robust finite-state or statistical systems (Hobbs et al.",
        "1997; Miller et al.",
        "1998).",
        "These newer systems rely on a shallower level of semantic representation, similar to the level we adopt for the Proposition Bank, but have also tended to be very domain specific.",
        "The systems are trained and evaluated on corpora annotated for semantic relations pertaining to, for example, corporate acquisitions or terrorist events.",
        "The Proposition Bank (PropBank) takes a similar approach in that we annotate predicates’ semantic roles, while steering clear of the issues involved in quantification and discourse-level structure.",
        "By annotating semantic roles for every verb in our corpus, we provide a more domain-independent resource, which we hope will lead to more robust and broad-coverage natural language understanding systems.",
        "The Proposition Bank focuses on the argument structure of verbs and provides a complete corpus annotated with semantic roles, including roles traditionally viewed as arguments and as adjuncts.",
        "It allows us for the first time to determine the frequency of syntactic variations in practice, the problems they pose for natural language understanding, and the strategies to which they may be susceptible.",
        "We begin the article by giving examples of the variation in the syntactic realization of semantic arguments and drawing connections to previous research into verb alternation behavior.",
        "In section 3 we describe our approach to semantic-role annotation, including the types of roles chosen and the guidelines for the annotators.",

        "2.",
        "Semantic Roles and Syntactic Alternation",
        "Our work in examining verb alternation behavior is inspired by previous research into the linking between semantic roles and syntactic realization, in particular, the comprehensive study of Levin (1993).",
        "Levin argues that syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the underlying semantics; the sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class reflect underlying semantic components that constrain allowable arguments.",
        "On this principle, Levin defines verb classes based on the ability of particular verbs to occur or not occur in pairs of syntactic frames that are in some sense meaning-preserving (diathesis alternations).",
        "The classes also tend to share some semantic component.",
        "For example, the break examples above are related by a transitive/intransitive alternation called the causative/inchoative alternation.",
        "Break and other verbs such as shatter and smash are also characterized by their ability to appear in the middle construction, as in Glass breaks/shatters/smashes easily.",
        "Cut, a similar change-of-state verb, seems to share in this syntactic behavior and can also appear in the transitive (causative) as well as the middle construction: John cut the bread, This loaf cuts easily.",
        "However, it cannot also occur in the simple intransitive: The window broke/*The bread cut.",
        "In contrast, cut verbs can occur in the conative – John valiantly cut/hacked at the frozen loaf, but his knife was too dull to make a dent in it – whereas break verbs cannot: *John broke at the window.",
        "The explanation given is that cut describes a series of actions directed at achieving the goal of separating some object into pieces.",
        "These actions consist of grasping an instrument with a sharp edge such as a knife and applying it in a cutting fashion to the object.",
        "It is possible for these actions to be",
        "performed without the end result being achieved, but such that the cutting manner can still be recognized, for example, John cut at the loaf.",
        "Where break is concerned, the only thing specified is the resulting change of state, in which the object becomes separated into pieces.",
        "VerbNet (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000; Kipper, Palmer, and Rambow 2002) extends Levin’s classes by adding an abstract representation of the syntactic frames for each class with explicit correspondences between syntactic positions and the semantic roles they express, as in Agent REL Patient or Patient REL into pieces for break.2 (For other extensions of Levin, see also Dorr and Jones [2000] and Korhonen, Krymolowsky, and Marx [2003].)",
        "The original Levin classes constitute the first few levels in the hierarchy, with each class subsequently refined to account for further semantic and syntactic differences within a class.",
        "The argument list consists of thematic labels from a set of 20 such possible labels (Agent, Patient, Theme, Experiencer, etc.).",
        "The syntactic frames represent a mapping of the list of schematic labels to deep-syntactic arguments.",
        "Additional semantic information for the verbs is expressed as a set (i.e., conjunction) of semantic predicates, such as motion, contact, transfer_ info.",
        "Currently, all Levin verb classes have been assigned thematic labels and syntactic frames, and over half the classes are completely described, including their semantic predicates.",
        "In many cases, the additional information that VerbNet provides for each class has caused it to subdivide, or use intersections of, Levin’s original classes, adding an additional level to the hierarchy (Dang et al.",
        "1998).",
        "We are also extending the coverage by adding new classes (Korhonen and Briscoe 2004).",
        "Our objective with the Proposition Bank is not a theoretical account of how and why syntactic alternation takes place, but rather to provide a useful level of representation and a corpus of annotated data to enable empirical study of these issues.",
        "We have referred to Levin’s classes wherever possible to ensure that verbs in the same classes are given consistent role labels.",
        "However, there is only a 50% overlap between verbs in VerbNet and those in the Penn TreeBank II, and PropBank itself does not define a set of classes, nor does it attempt to formalize the semantics of the roles it defines.",
        "While lexical resources such as Levin’s classes and VerbNet provide information about alternation patterns and their semantics, the frequency of these alternations and their effect on language understanding systems has never been carefully quantified.",
        "While learning syntactic subcategorization frames from corpora has been shown to be possible with reasonable accuracy (Manning 1993; Brent 1993; Briscoe and Carroll 1997), this work does not address the semantic roles associated with the syntactic arguments.",
        "More recent work has attempted to group verbs into classes based on alternations, usually taking Levin’s classes as a gold standard (McCarthy 2000; Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew 2002).",
        "But without an annotated corpus of semantic roles, this line of research has not been able to measure the frequency of alternations directly, or more generally, to ascertain how well the classes defined by Levin correspond to real-world data.",
        "We believe that a shallow labeled dependency structure provides a feasible level of annotation which, coupled with minimal coreference links, could provide the foundation for a major advance in our ability to extract salient relationships from text.",
        "This will in turn improve the performance of basic parsing and generation 2 These can be thought of as a notational variant of tree-adjoining grammar elementary trees or tree-adjoining grammar partial derivations (Kipper, Dang, and Palmer 2000).",
        "components, as well as facilitate advances in text understanding, machine translation, and fact retrieval.",
        "3.",
        "Annotation Scheme: Choosing the Set of Semantic Roles",
        "Because of the difficulty of defining a universal set of semantic or thematic roles covering all types of predicates, PropBank defines semantic roles on a verb-by-verb basis.",
        "An individual verb’s semantic arguments are numbered, beginning with zero.",
        "For a particular verb, Arg0 is generally the argument exhibiting features of a Prototypical Agent (Dowty 1991), while Arg1 is a Prototypical Patient or Theme.",
        "No consistent generalizations can be made across verbs for the higher-numbered arguments, though an effort has been made to consistently define roles across members of VerbNet classes.",
        "In addition to verb-specific numbered roles, PropBank defines several more general roles that can apply to any verb.",
        "The remainder of this section describes in detail the criteria used in assigning both types of roles.",
        "As examples of verb-specific numbered roles, we give entries for the verbs accept and kick below.",
        "These examples are taken from the guidelines presented to the annotators and are also available on the Web at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/˜cotton/ cgi-bin/pblex_fmt.cgi.",

        "A set of roles corresponding to a distinct usage of a verb is called a roleset and can be associated with a set of syntactic frames indicating allowable syntactic variations in the expression of that set of roles.",
        "The roleset with its associated frames is called a",
        " frameset.",
        "A polysemous verb may have more than one frameset when the differences in meaning are distinct enough to require a different set of roles, one for each frameset.",
        "The tagging guidelines include a ‘‘descriptor’’ field for each role, such as ‘‘kicker’’ or ‘‘instrument,’’ which is intended for use during annotation and as documentation but does not have any theoretical standing.",
        "In addition, each frameset is complemented by a set of examples, which attempt to cover the range of syntactic alternations afforded by that usage.",
        "The collection of frameset entries for a verb is referred to as the verb’s frames file.",
        "The use of numbered arguments and their mnemonic names was instituted for a number of reasons.",
        "Foremost, the numbered arguments plot a middle course among many different theoretical viewpoints.",
        "The numbered arguments can then be mapped easily and consistently onto any theory of argument structure, such as traditional theta role (Kipper, Palmer, and Rambow 2002), lexical-conceptual structure (Rambow et al.",
        "2003), or Prague tectogrammatics (Hajic˘ova and Kuc˘erova´ 2002).",
        "While most rolesets have two to four numbered roles, as many as six can appear, in particular for certain verbs of motion:4",
        "(14) Frameset edge.01 ‘‘move slightly’’ Arg0: causer of motion Arg3: start point Arg1: thing in motion Arg4: end point Arg2: distance moved Arg5: direction",

        "(wsj_1210)",
        "Because of the use of Arg0 for agency, there arose a small set of verbs in which an external force could cause the Agent to execute the action in question.",
        "For example, in the sentence ... Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office ... (wsj_0765), the staff is unmistakably the marcher, the agentive role.",
        "Yet Mr. Dinkins also has some degree of agency, since he is causing the staff to do the marching.",
        "To capture this, a special tag, ArgA, is used for the agent of an induced action.",
        "This ArgA tag is used only for verbs of volitional motion such as march and walk, modern uses of volunteer (e.g., Mary volunteered John to clean the garage, or more likely the passive of that, John was volunteered to clean the garage), and, with some hesitation, graduate based on usages such as Penn only graduates 35% of its students.",
        "(This usage does not occur as such in the Penn Treebank corpus, although it is evoked in the sentence No student should be permitted to be graduated from elementary school without having mastered the 3 R’s at the level that prevailed 20 years ago.",
        "(wsj_1286)) In addition to the semantic roles described in the rolesets, verbs can take any of a set of general, adjunct-like arguments (ArgMs), distinguished by one of the function tags shown in Table 1.",

        "Probabilities of a parse constituent belonging to a given semantic role are calculated from the following features: The phrase type feature indicates the syntactic type of the phrase expressing the semantic roles: Examples include noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), and clause (S).",
        "The parse tree path feature is designed to capture the syntactic relation of a constituent to the predicate.11 It is defined as the path from the predicate through the parse tree to the constituent in question, represented as a string of parse tree nonterminals linked by symbols indicating upward or downward movement through the tree, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Although the path is composed as a string of symbols, our systems treat the string as an atomic value.",
        "The path includes, as the first element of the string, the part of speech of the predicate, and as the last element, the phrase type or syntactic category of the sentence constituent marked as an argument.",
        "The position feature simply indicates whether the constituent to be labeled occurs before or after the predicate.",
        "This feature is highly correlated with grammatical function, since subjects will generally appear before a verb and objects after.",
        "This feature may overcome the shortcomings of reading grammatical function from the parse tree, as well as errors in the parser output.",
        "The voice feature distinguishes between active and passive verbs and is important in predicting semantic roles, because direct objects of active verbs correspond to subjects of passive verbs.",
        "An instance of a verb is considered passive if it is tagged as a past participle (e.g., taken), unless it occurs as a descendent verb phrase headed by any form of have (e.g., has taken) without an intervening verb phrase headed by any form of be (e.g., has been taken).",
        " The headword is a lexical feature and provides information about the semantic type of the role filler.",
        "Headwords of nodes in the parse tree are determined using the same deterministic set of headword rules used by Collins (1999).",
        "The system attempts to predict argument roles in new data, looking for the highest-probability assignment of roles ri to all constituents i in the sentence, given the set of features Fi ¼ fpti, pathi, posi, vi, hig at each constituent in the parse tree, and the predicate p:",
        "We break the probability estimation into two parts, the first being the probability Pðri j Fi,pÞ of a constituent’s role given our five features for the constituent and the predicate p. Because of the sparsity of the data, it is not possible to estimate this probability from the counts in the training data.",
        "Instead, probabilities are estimated from various subsets of the features and interpolated as a linear combination of the resulting distributions.",
        "The interpolation is performed over the most specific distributions for which data are available, which can be thought of as choosing the topmost distributions available from a back-off lattice, shown in Figure 3.",
        "Next, the probabilities Pðri j Fi,pÞ are combined with the probabilities Pðfr1 ::: ngjpÞ for a set of roles appearing in a sentence given a predicate, using the following formula:",
        "This approach, described in more detail in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), allows interaction among the role assignments for individual constituents while making certain independence assumptions necessary for efficient probability estimation.",
        "In particular, we assume that sets of roles appear independent of their linear order and that the features F of a constituent are independent of other constituents’ features given the constituent’s role.",
        "7.1.1 Results.",
        "We applied the same system, using the same features, to a preliminary release of the PropBank data.",
        "The data set used contained annotations for 72,109 predicate-argument structures containing 190,815 individual arguments and examples Figure 3 Back-off lattice with more specific distributions towards the top.",
        "Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury The Proposition Bank from 2,462 lexical predicates (types).",
        "In order to provide results comparable with the statistical parsing literature, annotations from section 23 of the treebank were used as the test set; all other sections were included in the training set.",
        "The preliminary version of the data used in these experiments was not tagged for WordNet word sense or PropBank frameset.",
        "Thus, the system neither predicts the frameset nor uses it as a feature.",
        "The system was tested under two conditions, one in which it is given the constituents which are arguments to the predicate and merely has to predict the correct role, and one in which it has to both find the arguments in the sentence and label them correctly.",
        "Results are shown in Tables 10 and 11.",
        "Results for FrameNet are based on a test set of 8,167 individual labels from 4,000 predicate-argument structures.",
        "As a guideline for interpreting these results, with 8,167 observations, the threshold for statistical significance with p <.05 is a 1.0% absolute difference in performance (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).",
        "For the PropBank data, with a test set of 8,625 individual labels, the threshold for significance is similar.",
        "There are 7,574 labels for which the predicate has been seen 10 or more times in training (third column of the tables).",
        "Results for PropBank are similar to those for FrameNet, despite the smaller number of training examples for many of the predicates.",
        "The FrameNet data contained at least 10 examples from each predicate, while 12% of the PropBank data had fewer than 10 training examples.",
        "Removing these examples from the test set gives 82.8% accuracy with gold-standard parses and 80.9% accuracy with automatic parses.",
        "7.1.2 Adding Traces.",
        "The gold-standard parses of the Penn Treebank include several types of information not typically produced by statistical parsers or included in their evaluation.",
        "Of particular importance are traces, empty syntactic categories which generally occupy the syntactic position in which another constituent could be interpreted and include a link to the relevant constituent.",
        "Traces are used to indicate cases of wh-extraction, antecedents of relative clauses, and control verbs exhibiting the syntactic phenomena of raising and ‘‘equi.’’ Traces are intended to provide hints as to the semantics of individual clauses, and the results in Table 11 show that they do so effectively.",
        "When annotating syntactic trees, the PropBank annotators marked the traces along with their antecedents as arguments of the relevant verbs.",
        "In line 2 of Table 11, along with all our experiments with automatic parser output, traces were ignored, and the semantic-role label was assigned to the antecedent in both training and test data.",
        "In line 3 of Table 11, we assume that the system is given trace information, and in cases of trace chains, the semantic-role label is assigned to the trace in training and test conditions.",
        "Trace information boosts the performance of the system by roughly 5%.",
        "This indicates that systems capable of recovering traces (Johnson 2002; Dienes and Dubey 2003) could improve semantic-role labeling.",
        "As our path feature is a somewhat unusual way of looking at parse trees, its behavior in the system warrants a closer look.",
        "The path feature is most useful as a way of finding arguments in the unknown boundary condition.",
        "Removing the path feature from the known-boundary system results in only a small degradation in performance, from 82.0% to 80.1%.",
        "One reason for the relatively small impact may be sparseness of the feature: 7% of paths in the test set are unseen in training data.",
        "The most common values of the feature are shown in Table 12, in which the first two rows correspond to standard subject and object positions.",
        "One reason for sparsity is seen in the third row: In the treebank, the adjunction of an adverbial phrase or modal verb can cause an additional VP node to appear in our path feature.",
        "We tried two variations of the path feature to address this problem.",
        "The first collapses sequences of nodes with the same label, for example, combining rows 2 and 3 of Table 12.",
        "The second variation uses only two values for the feature: NP under S (subject position) and NP under VP (object position).",
        "Neither variation improved performance in the known-boundary condition.",
        "As a gauge of how closely the PropBank semantic-role labels correspond to the path feature overall, we note that by always assigning the most common role for each path (for example, always assigning Arg0 to the subject position), and using no other features, we obtain the correct role 64.0% of the time, versus 82.0% for the complete system.",
        "Conditioning on the path and predicate, which allows the subject of different verbs to receive different labels but does not allow for alternation behavior within a verb’s argument structure, yields an accuracy rate of 76.6%.",
        "Table 13 shows the performance of the system broken down by the argument types in the gold standard.",
        "Results are shown for the unknown-boundaries condition, using gold-standard parses and traces (last row, middle two columns of Table 11).",
        "The",
        "‘‘Labeled Recall’’ column shows how often the semantic-role label is correctly identified, while the ‘‘Unlabeled recall’’ column shows how often a constituent with the given role is correctly identified as being a semantic role, even if it is labeled with the wrong role.",
        "The more central, numbered roles are consistently easier to identify than the adjunct-like ArgM roles, even when the ArgM roles have preexisting Treebank function tags."

        "(1997) built finite-state recognizers for various entities, which were then cascaded to form recognizers for higher-level relations, while Ray and Craven (2001) used low-level ‘‘chunks’’ from a general-purpose syntactic analyzer as observations in a trained hidden Markov model.",
        "Such an approach has a large advantage in speed, as the extensive search of modern statistical parsers is avoided.",
        "It is also possible that this approach may be more robust to error than parsers.",
        "Our experiments working with a flat, ‘‘chunked’’ representation of the input sentence, described in more detail in Gildea and Palmer (2002), test this finite-state hypothesis.",
        "In the chunked representation, base-level constituent boundaries and labels are present, but there are no dependencies between constituents, as shown by the following sample sentence: (48) [NP Big investment banks] [VP refused to step] [ADVP up] [PP to] [NP the plate] [VP to support] [NP the beleaguered floor traders] [PP by] [VP buying] [NP bigblocks] [PP of] [NP stock], [NP traders] [VP say].",

        "Thus, the experiments were carried out using",
        " gold-standard rather than automatically derived chunk boundaries, which we believe will provide an upper bound on the performance of a chunk-based system.",
        "Distance in chunks from the predicate was used in place of the parser-based path feature.",
        "The results in Table 14 show that full parse trees are much more effective than the chunked representation for labeling semantic roles.",
        "This is the case even if we relax the scoring criteria to count as correct all cases in which the system correctly identifies the first chunk belonging to an argument (last row of Table 14).",
        "As an example for comparing the behavior of the tree-based and chunk-based systems, consider the following sentence, with human annotations showing the arguments of the predicate support: (49) [Arg0 Big investment banks] refused to step up to the plate to support [Arg1 the beleaguered floor traders] [MNR by buying big blocks of stock], traders say.",
        "Our system based on automatic parser output assigned the following analysis: (50) Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support [Arg1 the beleaguered floor traders] [MNR by buying big blocks of stock], traders say.",
        "In this case, the system failed to find the predicate’s Arg0 relation, because it is syntactically distant from the verb support.",
        "The original treebank syntactic tree contains a trace which would allow one to recover this relation, coindexing the empty subject position of support with the noun phrase Big investment banks.",
        "However, our automatic parser output does not include such traces.",
        "The system based on gold-standard trees and incorporating trace information produced exactly the correct labels: (51) [Arg0 Big investment banks] refused to step up to the plate to support [Arg1 the beleaguered floor traders] [MNR by buying big blocks of stock], traders say.",
        "The system based on (gold-standard) chunks assigned the following semantic-role labels: (52) Big investment banks refused to step up to [Arg0 the plate] to support [Arg1 the beleaguered floor traders] by buying big blocks of stock, traders say.",
        "Here, as before, the true Arg0 relation is not found, and it would be difficult to imagine identifying it without building a complete syntactic parse of the sentence.",
        "But now,",
        "unlike in the tree-based output, the Arg0 label is mistakenly attached to a noun phrase immediately before the predicate.",
        "The Arg1 relation in direct-object position is fairly easily identifiable in the chunked representation as a noun phrase directly following the verb.",
        "The prepositional phrase expressing the Manner relation, however, is not identified by the chunk-based system.",
        "The tree-based system’s path feature for this constituent is VBTVPIPP, which identifies the prepositional phrase as attaching to the verb and increases its probability of being assigned an argument label.",
        "The chunk-based system sees this as a prepositional phrase appearing as the second chunk after the predicate.",
        "Although this may be a typical position for the Manner relation, the fact that the preposition attaches to the predicate rather than to its direct object is not represented.",
        "Participants in the 2004 CoNLL semantic-labeling shared task (Carreras and Ma`rquez 2004) have reported higher results for chunk-based systems, but to date chunk-based systems have not closed the gap with the state-of-the-art results based on parser output.",
        "7.2.1 Parsing and Models of Syntax.",
        "While treebank parsers such as that of Collins (1999) return much richer representations than a chunker, they do not include a great deal of the information present in the original Penn Treebank.",
        "Specifically, long-distance dependencies indicated by traces in the treebank are crucial for semantic interpretation but do not affect the constituent recall and precision metrics most often used to evaluate parsers and are not included in the output of the standard parsers.",
        "Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) present a system for labeling PropBank’s semantic roles based on a statistical parser for combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman 2000).",
        "The parser, described in detail in Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002), is trained on a version of the Penn Treebank automatically converted to CCG representations.",
        "The conversion process uses the treebank’s trace information to make underlying syntactic relations explicit.",
        "For example, the same CCG-level relation appears between a verb and its direct object whether the verb is used in a simple transitive clause, a relative clause, or a question with wh-extraction.",
        "Using the CCG-based parser, Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) find a 2% absolute improvement over the Collins parser in identifying core or numbered PropBank arguments.",
        "This points to the shortcomings of evaluating parsers purely on constituent precision and recall; we feel that a dependency-based evaluation (e.g., Carroll, Briscoe, and Sanfilippo 1998) is more relevant to real-world applications.",

        "Conclusion The Proposition Bank takes the comprehensive corpus annotation of the Penn Treebank one step closer to a detailed semantic representation by adding semantic-role labels.",
        "On analyzing the data, the relationships between syntax and semantic structures are more complex than one might at first expect.",
        "Alternations in the realization of semantic arguments of the type described by Levin (1993) turn out to be common in practice as well as in theory, even in the limited genre of Wall Street Journal articles.",
        "Even so, by using detailed guidelines for the annotation of each individual verb, rapid consistent annotation has been achieved, and the corpus is available through the Linguistic Data Consortium.",
        "For information on obtaining the frames file, please consult http://www.cis.upenn.edu/˜ace/.",
        " The broad-coverage annotation has proven to be suitable for training automatic taggers, and in addition to ourselves there is a growing body of researchers engaged in this task.",

        "2003) and using maximum-entropy classifiers (He and Gildea 2004, Xue and Palmer 2004).",
        "This group also used Charniak’s parser instead of Collins’s and tested the system on TDT data.",
        "The performance on a new genre is lower, as would be expected.",
        "Despite the complex relationship between syntactic and semantic structures, we find that statistical parsers, although computationally expensive, do a good job of providing information relevant for this level of semantic interpretation.",
        "In addition to the constituent structure, the headword information, produced as a side product, is an important feature.",
        "Automatic parsers, however, still have a long way to go.",
        "Our results using hand-annotated parse trees including traces show that improvements in parsing should translate directly into more accurate semantic representations.",
        "There has already been a demonstration that a preliminary version of these data can be used to simplify the effort involved in developing information extraction (IE) systems.",
        "Researchers were able to construct a reasonable IE system by simply mapping specific Arg labels for a set of verbs to template slots, completely avoiding the necessity of building explicit regular expression pattern matchers (Surdeanu et al.",
