        "The discourse properties of text have long been recognized as critical to language technology, and over the past 40 years, our understanding of and ability to exploit the discourse properties of text has grown in many ways.",
        "This essay briefly recounts these developments, the technology they employ, the applications they support, and the new challenges that each subsequent development has raised.",
        "We conclude with the challenges faced by our current understanding of discourse, and the applications that meeting these challenges will promote.",
        "1 Why bother with discourse?",
        "Research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has long benefitted from the fact that text can often be treated as simply a bag of words or a bag of sentences.",

        "Order often matters ?",
        "e.g., very different events are conveyed depending on how clauses and sentences are ordered.",
        "(1) a. I said the magic words, and a genie appeared.",
        "b.",
        "A genie appeared, and I said the magic words.",
        "Adjacency often matters ?",
        "e.g., attributed material may span a sequence of adjacent sentences, and contrasts are visible through sentence juxtaposition.",
        "Context always matters ?",
        "e.g., All languages achieve economy through minimal expressions that can only convey intended meaning when understood in context.",
        "Position, order, adjacency and context are intrinsic features of discourse, and research on discourse processing attempts to solve the challenges posed by context-bound expressions and the discourse structures that give rise, when linearized, to position, order and adjacency.",
        "But challenges are not why Language Technology (LT) researchers should care about discourse: Rather, discourse can enable LT to overcome known obstacles to better performance.",
        "Consider automated summarization and machine translation: Humans regularly judge output quality in terms that include referential clarity and coherence.",
        "Systems can only improve here by paying attention to discourse ?",
        "i.e., to linguistic features above the level of n-grams and single sentences.",
        "(In fact, we predict that as soon as cheap ?",
        "i.e., non-manual ?",
        "methods are found for reliably assessing these features ?",
        "for example, using proxies like those suggested in (Pitler et al., 2010) ?",
        "they will supplant, or at least complement today's common metrics, Bleu and Rouge that say little about what matters to human text understanding (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).)",
        "Consider also work on automated text simplification: One way that human editors simplify text is by re-expressing a long complex sentence as a discourse sequence of simple sentences.",
        "Researchers should be able to automate this through understanding the various ways that information is conveyed in discourse.",
        "Other examples of LT applications already benefitting from recognizing and applying discourse-level information include automated assessment of student essays (Burstein and Chodorow, 2010); summarization (Thione et al., 2004), infor",
        "mation extraction (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2007; Eales et al., 2008; Maslennikov and Chua, 2007), and more recently, statistical machine translation (Foster et al., 2010).",
        "These are described in more detail in (Webber et al., 2012).",
        "Our aim here then, on this occasion of ACL's 50th Annual Meeting, is to briefly describe the evolution of computational approaches to discourse structure, reflect on where the field currently stands, and what new challenges it faces in trying to deliver on its promised benefit to Language Technology."

        "Since these early systems never saw more than a handful of examples, they could successfully employ straight-forward, but ad hoc methods to handle the discourse problems the examples posed.",
        "For example, LUNAR used a single 10-position ring buffer to store discourse entities associated with both the user's and the system's referring expressions, resolving pronouns by looking back through the buffer for an appropriate entity and overwriting previous buffer entries when the buffer was full.",
        "The next wave of work in computational discourse processing sought greater generality through stronger theoretical grounding, appealing to then-current theories of discourse such as Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1986; Grosz et al., 1995), used as a basis for anaphor resolution (Brennan et al., 1987; Walker et al., 1997; Tetreault, 2001) and text generation (Kibble and Power, 2000), Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988), used as a basis for text generation (Moore, 1995) and document summarization (Marcu, 2000b), and Grosz and Sid-ner's theory of discourse based on intentions (Grosz and Sidner, 1986a) and shared plans (Grosz and Sidner, 1990), used in developing animated agents (Johnson and Rickel, 2000).",

        "While early work focussed on the correct assumption that much was implicit in text and had to be inferred from the explicit sequence of sentences that constituted a text, work during the next period focussed on the underlying structure of discourse and its consequences.",
        "More specificaly, it assumed that the sequence of sentences constituting the text were covered by a single tree structure, similar to the single tree structure of phrases and clauses covering the",

        "At issue though was the nature of the structure.",
        "One issue concerned the nature of the relation between parent and child nodes in a discourse tree, and/or the relation between siblings.",
        "While Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) posited a single discourse relation holding between any two discourse units (i.e., units projecting to adjacent text spans), Moore and Pollack (1992) gave an example of a simple discourse (Ex.",

        "s2 That way we can finish the bookshelves tonight.",
        "s3 Example 4 could be analysed purely in terms of information-based discourse relations, in which s1 specified the CONDITION under which s2 held, which in turn specified the CONDITION under which s3 held.",
        "This would make s1 subordinate to s2, which in turn would be subordinate to s3, as in Figure 1a.",
        "Alternatively, Example 4 could be analysed purely in terms of intention-based (pragmatic) relations, in which s2 would be MOTIVATION for s1, while s3 would be MOTIVATION for s2.",
        "This would make s3 subordinate to s2, which in turn would be subordinate to s1, as in Figure 1b.",
        "In short, the choice of relation was not merely a matter of labels, but had structural implications as well.",
        "Another issue during this period concerned the nature of discourse structure: Was it really a tree?",
        "Sibun (1992), looking at people's descriptions of the layout of their house or apartment, argued that they resembled different ways of linearizing a graph of the rooms and their connectivity through doors and halls.",
        "None of these linearizations were trees.",
        "Similarly, Knott et al. (2001), looking at transcriptions of museum tours, argued that each resembled a linear sequence of trees, with one or more topic-based connections between their root nodes ?",
