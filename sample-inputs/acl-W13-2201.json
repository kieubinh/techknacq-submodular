        "This year the following subtasks were proposed: prediction of percentage of word edits necessary to fix a sentence, ranking of up to five alternative translations for a given source sentence, prediction of post-editing time for a sentence, and prediction of word-level scores for a given translation (correct/incorrect and types of edits).",

        "If such annotation is presented through a user interface we imagine that words marked as incorrect would be hidden from the editor, highlighted as possibly wrong or that a list of alternatives would we generated.",
        "With respect to the poor improvements over trivial baselines, we consider that the results for word-level prediction could be mostly connected to limitations of the datasets provided, which are very small for word-level prediction, as compared to successful previous work such as (Bach et al., 2011).",
        "Despite the limited amount of training data, several systems were able to predict dubious words (binary variant of the task), showing that this can be a promising task.",
        "Extending the granularity even further by predicting the actual editing action necessary for a word yielded less positive results than the binary setting.",
        "We cannot directly compare sentence-and word-level results.",
        "However, since sentence-level predictions can benefit from more information available and therefore more signal on which the prediction is based, the natural conclusion is that, if there is a choice in the prediction granularity, to opt for the coarser one possible (i.e., sentence-level over word-level).",
        "But certain applications may require finer granularity levels, and therefore word-level predictions can still be very valuable.",
        "Explore the prediction of more objective scores Given the multitude of possible applications for quality estimation we must decide which predicted values are both useful and accurate.",
        "In this year's task we have attempted to address the usefulness criterion by moving from the subjective, human judgement-based scores, to the prediction of scores that can be more easily interpreted for practical applications: post-editing distance or types of edits (word-level), post-editing time, and ranking of alternative translations.",
        "The general promise of using objective scores is that predicting a value that is related to the use case will make quality estimation more applicable and yield lower deviance compared to the use of proxy metrics.",
        "The magnitude of this benefit should be sufficient to account for the possible additional effort related to collecting such scores.",
        "While a direct comparison between the different types of scores used for this year's tasks is not possible as they are based on different datasets, if we compare last year's task on predicting 1-5 lik-ert scores (and generating an overall ranking of all translations in the test set) with this year's Task 1.1, which is virtually the same, but using post-editing distance as gold-label, we see that the number of systems that outperform the baseline 18 is proportionally larger this year.",
        "We can also notice a higher relative improvement of these submissions over the baseline system.",
        "While this could simply be a consequence of progress in the field, it may also provide an indication that objective metrics are more suitable for the problem.",
        "Particularly with respect to post-editing time, given that this label has a long tailed distribution and is not trivial to measure even in a controlled environment, the results of Task 1.3 are encouraging.",
        "Comparison with the better results seen on Tasks 1.1 and 1.2, however, suggests that, for Task 1.3, additional data processing, filtering, and modelling (including modelling translator-specific traits such as their variance in time) is required, as evidenced in (Cohn and Specia, 2013).",
        "Explore the use of quality estimation techniques to replace reference-based MT evaluation metrics When it comes to the task of automatically ranking alternative translations generated by different MT systems, the traditional use of reference-based MT evaluation metrics is challenged by the findings of this task.",

        "The most interesting property of these techniques is that, being reference-free, they can be used for any source sentences, and therefore are ready to be deployed for arbitrary texts.",
        "An immediate application for this capability is a procedure by which MT system-selection is performed, based on the output of such quality estimators.",

        "Identify new and effective quality indicators Quality indicators, or features, are core to the problem of quality estimation.",

        "as opposed to the 17 baseline features used in the 2012 edition ?",

        "These were borrowed from work on style or authorship identification.",
        "The assumption is that low/high quality translations can be characterised by some patterns which are frequent and/or differ significantly from patterns belonging to the opposite category.",
        "Like in last year's task, the vast majority of the participating systems used external resources in addition to those provided for the task, particularly for linguistically-oriented features, such as parsers, part-of-speech taggers, named entity recognizers, etc.",
        "A novel set of syntactic features based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) performed reasonably well in Task 1.2: with six CCG-based features and no additional features, the system outperformed the baseline system and also a second submission where the 17 baseline features were added.",

        "As expected, different feature sets were used for different tasks.",
        "This is essential for Task 2, where word-level features are certainly necessary.",
        "For example, LIG used a number of lexical features such as part-of-speech tag, word-posterior probabilities, syntactic (constituent label, distance to the constituent tree root, and target and source polysemy count).",
