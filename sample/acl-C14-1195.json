        "Synchronous context free grammars (SCFGs) are widely used in statistical machine translation (SMT), with hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005) as the dominant approach.",
        "Hiero grammars are easily extracted from word-aligned parallel corpora and can capture complex nested translation relationships.",
        "Hiero grammars are formally syntactic, but rules are not constrained by source or target language syntax.",
        "This lack of constraint can lead to intractable decoding and bad performance due to the over-generation of derivations in translation.",
        "To avoid these problems, the extraction and application of SCFG rules is typically constrained by a source language span limit; (non-glue) rules are lexicalised; and rules are limited to two non-terminals which are not allowed to be adjacent in the source language.",
        "These constraints can yield good performing translation systems, although at a sacrifice in the ability to model long-distance movement and complex reordering of multiple constituents.",
        "By contrast, the GHKM approach to translation (Galley et al., 2006) relies on a syntactic parse on either the source or target language side to guide SCFG extraction and translation.",
        "The parse tree provides linguistically-motivated constraints both in grammar extraction and in translation.",
        "This allows for looser span constraints; rules need not be lexicalised; and rules can have more than two non-terminals to model complex reordering multiple constituents.",
        "There are also modelling benefits as more meaningful features can be used to encourage derivations with ?well-formed?",
        "syntactic tree structures.",
        "However, GHKM can have robustness problems in that translation relies on the quality of the parse tree and the diversity of rule types can lead to sparsity and limited coverage.",
        "In this paper we describe a simple but effective approach to introducing source language syntax into hierarchical phrase-based translation to get the benefits of both approaches.",
        "Unlike previous work, we do not resort to soft/hard syntactic constraints (Marton and Resnik, 2008; Li et al., 2013) or Hiero-style rule extraction algorithms for incorporating syntactic annotation into SCFGs (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Zhao and Al-Onaizan, 2008; Chiang, 2010).",
        "We instead use GHKM syntactic rules to augment the baseline Hiero grammar and decoder.",

        "2 Background 2.1 Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation In the hierarchical phrase-based approach, translation is modelled using SCFGs.",
        "In general, probabilistic SCFGs can be learned from word-aligned parallel data using heuristic methods (Chiang, 2007).",
        "We can first extract initial phrase pairs and then obtain hierarchical phrase rules (i.e., rules with non-terminals on the right hand side).",
        "Once the SCFG is obtained, new sentences can be decoded by finding the most likely derivation of SCFG rules.",
        "See Figure 1 for example rules extracted from a sentence pair with word alignments.",
        "A sequence of such rules covering the words of the source sentence is a SCFG derivation, e.g., rules h 7 , h 1 and h 3 generate a derivation for the sentence pair.",
        "The Hiero SCFG allows vast numbers of derivations which can make unconstrained decoding intractable.",
        "In practice, several constraints are applied to control the model size and reduce ambiguity.",
        "Typically these are: (a) a rule span limit to be applied in decoding and sometimes also in rule extraction, set to 10; (b) a limit on the rank of the grammar (number of non-terminals that can appear on a rule), set to 2; and (c) a prohibition of consecutive non-terminals on the source language side of a rule (except the glue rules).",
        "2.2 Tree-to-String Translation Instead of modelling the problem based on surface strings, tree-to-string systems model the translation equivalency relations from source language syntactic trees to target language strings using derivations of tree-to-string rules (Liu et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008; Huang and Mi, 2010; Feng et al., 2012).",
        "A tree-to-string rule is a tuple 's r , t r ,?",
        "?, where s r is a source language tree-fragment with terminals and non-terminals at leaves; t r is a string of target-language terminals and non-terminals; and ?",
        "is a 1-to-1 alignment between the non-terminals of s r and t r , for example, VP(VV(??)",
        "x 1 :NN)?",
        "increases x 1 is a tree-to-string rule, where the non-terminals labeled with the same index x 1 indicate the alignment.",
        "To obtain tree-to-string rules, a popular way is to perform the GHKM rule extraction (Galley et al., 2006) on the bilingual sentences with both word alignment and source (or target) language phrase-structure tree annotations.",
        "In GHKM extraction, we first compute the set of the minimally-sized translation rules that can explain the mappings between source language tree and target-language string while respecting the alignment and reordering between the two languages.",
        "More complex rules are then learned by composing two or more minimal rules.",
        "See Figure 1 for rules extracted using GHKM.",

        "Also, one can use rules with consecutive (or more than two) source language non-terminals when the source language parse tree is available.",
        "For example, r 8 in Figure 1 has a good Chinese syntactic structure indicating the reordered translations of NP and VP.",
        "However, such a rule would not normally be included in a Hiero grammar, as it would require consecutive source language non-terminals (see Figure 3).",
        "3 The Proposed Approach Both the tree-to-string model and the hierarchical phrase-based model have their own strengths and weaknesses.",
        "For example, tree-to-string systems are good at modelling long distance reordering, while hierarchical phrase-based systems are relatively more powerful in handling ill-formed sentences 1 and free translations (Zhao and Al-Onaizan, 2008; Vilar et al., 2010).",
        "Here we present a method to enhance hierarchical phrase-based systems with tree-to-string rules and benefit from both models.",
        "The idea is simple: we obtain both the tree-to-string grammar and the Hiero-style SCFG from the training data, and then use tree-to-string rules as additional rules in decoding with the SCFG.",
        "Figure 2 shows an overview of our approach and the usual hierarchical phrase-based approach.",
        "Our approach requires source language parse trees to be input in both rule extraction and decoding.",
        "In rule extraction, we acquire tree-to-string rules using the GHKM method and Hiero-style rules using the Hiero-style rule extraction method to form a larger SCFG.",
        "Then, we make use of both the input string and parse tree to decode with the SCFG rules.",
        "We now describe our approach.",
        "3.1 Transforming Tree-to-String Rules into SCFG Rules As described in Section 2, tree-to-string rules have a different form from that of SCFG rules.",
        "We will use tree-to-string rules in our hierarchical phrase-based systems by converting each tree-to-string rule into an SCFG rule.",
        "The purpose of doing this is to make tree-to-string rules directly accessible to the Hiero-style decoder which performs decoding with SCFG rules.",
        "The rule mapping is straightforward: given a tree-to-string rule 's r , t r ,?",
        "?, we take the frontier nodes of s r as the source language part of the right hand side of the resulting SCFG rule, and keep t r and ?",
        "unchanged.",
        "Then we replace the non-terminal label with that used in the hierarchical phrase-based system (e.g., X).",
        "See Figure 3 for rule mapping of rule r 8 of Figure 1.",
        "In this way, every tree-to-string rule is associated with exactly one SCFG rule.",
        "Therefore we can obtain a larger SCFG by combining the rules from the original Hiero-style SCFG and the transformed tree-to-string rules.",
        "As explained next, to prevent computational problems we will apply these new rules 1 For example, the parser fails for 4% of the sentences in our training corpus, and 3% and 6% of the newswire and web development/test sentences, indicating that the data is sometimes ill-formed.",
        "2066 only on the spans that are consistent with the input parse trees.",
        "The main goal is to use the tree and the adapted tree-to-string rules to provide the decoder with new linguistically-sensible translation hypotheses that may be prevented by the usual Hiero constraints, and to do so without incurring a computational explosion.",
        "We categorize SCFG rules into two categories based on their availability in Hiero and GHKM extraction.",
        "If an SCFG rule is obtained from Hiero extraction, it is a type 1 rule; If not (i.e., this rule is only available in GHKM extraction), it is a type 2 rule.",
        "E.g., the SCFG rule in Figure 3 is a type 2 rule because it is not available in the original Hiero-style SCFG but can be generated from the tree-to-string rule.",
        "Next we describe how each of these rule types are applied in decoding.",
        "We also describe which features are used and how they are computed for each rule type.",
        "3.2 Decoding Both types of SCFG rules can be employed by usual Hiero decoders with a slight modification.",
        "Here we follow the description of Hiero decoding by Iglesias et al. (2011).",
        "The source sentence is parsed under the Hiero grammar using the CYK algorithm.",
        "Each cell in the CYK grid has associated with it a list of rules that apply to its span; these rules are used to construct a recursive transition network (RTN) which represents all translations of the source sentence under the grammar.",
        "The RTN is expanded to a weighted finite state automaton for composition with n-gram language models (de Gispert et al., 2010).",
        "Translations are produced via shortest path computation.",
        "This procedure accommodates type 1 rules directly.",
        "For tree-to-string rules associated with type 2, we attempt to match rules to the source syntactic tree.",
        "If a match is found: the source span of the matching tree fragment is noted and the CYK cell for that span is selected; the tree-to-string rule is converted to a Hiero-style rule; and that rule is added to the list of rules in the selected CYK cell.",
        "Once this process is finished, RTN construction, expansion, and language model composition proceeds as usual.",
        "Similar modifications could be made to incorporate these rules into cube pruning (Chiang, 2007), cube growing (Huang and Chiang, 2007), and PDT intersection and expansion (Iglesias et al., 2011).",
        "We now elaborate on the rule matching strategy.",
        "Type 1 Rules The source sentence is parsed as is usual in Hiero-style translation, with the exception that we impose no span limit on rule applications for source spans corresponding to constituents in the Chinese syntactic tree.",
        "Rule matching, the procedure that determines if a rule applies to a source span, is based on string matching (see Figure 4(a)).",
        "For example, the type 1 rule h 9 in Figure 4(c) can be applied to spans (1,13) and (2,13) since both of them agree with tree constituents (see Figure 4(b)).",
        "But h 9 is not applied to span (3,13) because that span is longer than 10 words and agrees with no syntactic tree constituent.",
        "Type 2 Rules If the source side of a tree-to-string rule matches an input tree fragment: 1) that rule is converted to a Hiero-style SCFG rule (Section 3.1); and 2) the Hiero-style rule is added to the rules linked with the CYK grid cell associated with the span of the source syntactic tree fragment.",
        "Here, rules are applied via tree matching.",
        "For example, rule h 11 in Figure 4(b) matches the tree fragment spanning positions (2,13).",
        "It is worth noting that some type 1 rules may be found via both Hiero-style and tree-to-string grammar extraction.",
        "In this case we monitor whether a rule can be applied as a tree-to-string rule using tree-matching so that features (Section 3.3) and weights can be set appropriately.",
        "As an example, rule h 10 in Figure 4 is available in both extraction methods.",
        "For span (2,11), this rule can be matched via both string matching and tree matching.",
        "We then note that we can apply h 10 as a tree-to-string rule for span (2, 11) and activate the corresponding features defined in Section 3.3.",
        "For other spans (e.g., spans (2,3)-(2,10)), no tree fragments can be matched and the baseline features are used for h 10 .",
        "3.3 Features The baseline feature set used in this work consists of 12 features (Pino et al., 2013), including a 4-gram language model, a strong 5-gram language model, bidirectional translation probabilities, bidirectional lexical weights, a word count, a phrase count, a glue rule count, a frequency-1 rule count, a frequency-2 2067 h9 : X?",

        "Alternatively, the hierarchical phrase-based approach (Chiang, 2005) considers the underlying hierarchical structures of sentences but does not require linguistically syntactic trees on either language side.",

        "Liu et al. (2009b) describe novel approaches to translation under multiple translation grammars.",

        "They demonstrate their approach by combining full tree-to-string and Hiero systems.",
        "Our approach is much simpler and emphasises changes to the grammar rather than the decoder or its parameter optimisation (MERT).",
        "Our aim is to augment the search space of Hiero with linguistically-motivated hypotheses, and not to develop a new decoder that is capable of translation under multiple grammars.",
        "Moreover, we consider Hiero as the backbone model and only introduce tree-to-string rules where they can contribute; we show that extracting tree-to-string rules from just 10% of the data suffices to get good gains.",
        "This results in a small number of tree-to-string rules and does not slow down the decoder.",
