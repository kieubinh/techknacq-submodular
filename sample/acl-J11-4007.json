        "Multi-document summarization has been an active area of research over the past two decades and yet, barring a few exceptions (Radev and McKeown 1998; Daumé III et al.",
        "2002; Barzilay and McKeown 2005), most systems still use shallow features to produce an extractive summary, an age-old technique (Luhn 1958) that has well-known problems.",
        "Extractive summaries may contain phrases that the reader cannot understand out of context (Paice 1990) and irrelevant phrases that happen to occur in a relevant sentence (Knight and Marcu 2000; Barzilay 2003).",
        "Referring expressions in extractive summaries illustrate this, as sentences compiled from different documents might contain too little, too much, or repeated information about the referent.",
        "In a study of how summary revisions could be used to improve cohesion in multi-document summarization (Otterbacher, Radev, and Luo 2002), automatic summaries were manually revised and the revisions classified as pertaining to discourse (34% of all revisions), entities (26%), temporal ordering (22%), and grammar (12%).",
        "This study further supports the findings from early research that unclear references in summaries pose serious problems for users (Paice 1990).",
        "2.1.1 Sentence Compression and Fusion.",
        "Research in abstractive summarization has largely focused on the problem of compression, developing techniques to edit sentences by removing information that is not salient from extracted sentences.",
        "Some approaches use linguistic rules (e.g., Zajic et al.",
        "2007) often combined with corpus-based information (Jing and McKeown 2000), whereas other approaches use statistical compression applied to news (Knight and Marcu 2000; Daumé III and Marcu 2002) and to spoken dialogue (Galley and McKeown 2007).",
        "Other researchers addressed the problem of generating new sentences to include in a summary.",
        "Information fusion, which uses bottom-up multi-sequence alignment of the parse trees of similar sentences, generates new summary sentences from phrases extracted from different document sentences (Barzilay and McKeown 2005; Filippova and Strube 2008).",
        "2.1.2 Summary Revision.",
        "Research in single-document summarization on improving summaries through revision (Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999) is closer to our work.",
        "Three types of ad hoc revision rules are defined – elimination (removing parentheticals, sentence initial prepositional phrases, and adverbial phrases), aggregation (combining constituents from two sentences), and smoothing.",
        "The smoothing operators cover some reference editing operations.",
        "They include substitution of a proper name with a name alias if the name is mentioned earlier, expansion of a pronoun with co-referential proper name in a parenthetical, and replacement of a definite NP with a co-referential indefinite if the definite occurs without a prior indefinite.",
        "Mani et al.",
        "'s (1999) work differs from ours in that it focuses primarily on subsequent mention (with the exception of pronoun replacement), is meant to work for all entities, not just mentions to people, and does not incorporate distinctions inferred from the input to the summarizer.",
        "Although the rules and the overall approach are based on reasonable intuitions, in practice entity rewrites for summarization do introduce errors, some due to the rewrite rules themselves, others due to problems with co-reference resolution and parsing.",
        "Readers are very sensitive to these errors and prefer extractive summaries to summaries where all references have been edited (Nenkova 2008).",
        "Automatic anaphora resolution for all entities mentioned in the input and summary text is also errorful, with about one third of all substitutions in the summary being incorrect (Steinberger et al.",
        "2007).",
        "In contrast, when editing references is restricted to references to people alone, as we do in the work presented here, there are fewer edits per summary but the overall result is perceived as better than the original by readers (Nenkova and McKeown 2003).",
        "2.1.3 Reference in Summaries.",
        "There has been little investigation of the phenomenon of reference in news summaries.",
        "In addition to the revision of subsequent references described in Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn (1999), we are aware of Radev and McKeown (1997), who built a prototype system called PROFILE that extracted references to people from news, merging and recording information about people mentioned in various news articles.",
        "The idea behind the system was that the rich profiles collected for people could be used in summaries of later news in order to generate informative descriptions.",
        "However, the collection of information about entities from different contexts and different points in time leads to complications in description generation; for example, past news can refer to Bill Clinton as Clinton, an Arkansas native, the democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton, U.S. President Clinton,orformer president Clinton and it is not clear which of these descriptions are appropriate to use in a summary of a novel news item.",
        "In later work, Radev and McKeown (1998) developed an approach to learn correlations between linguistic indicators and semantic constraints to address such problems, but this line of research has not been pursued further.",
        "Next, we review related work on reference outside the field of summarization."

        "2.2.1 Information Status Distinctions.",
        "Information status distinctions depend on two parameters related to the referent's place in the discourse model maintained by the reader: (a) whether it already exists in the hearer's model of the discourse and (b) its degree of salience.",
        "The influence of these distinctions on the form of referring expressions has been a focus of past research.",
        "For example, centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) deals predominantly with local salience (local attentional status), and the givenness hierarchy of Prince (1992) focuses on how a referent entered the discourse model (e.g., through a direct mention in the current discourse, through previous knowledge, or through inference), leading to distinctions such as discourse-old, discourse-new, hearer-old, hearer-new, inferable, and containing inferable.",
        "Gundel, Hedberg, and Zacharski (1993) attempt to merge salience and givenness in a single hierarchy consisting of six distinctions in cognitive status (in focus, activated, familiar, uniquely identifiable, referential, type-identifiable).",
        "In all three theories, familiarity and salience distinctions are shown to be associated with different preferences for syntactic form in the realization of referring expressions.",
        "2.2.2 Generating Referring Expressions (GRE).",
        "The most developed sub-area of referring expression generation deals with the problem of generating distinguishing descriptions – descriptions that include enough attributes of the intended referent so that it becomes uniquely identifiable among other entities (Dale 1992).",
        "The original",
        "Information Status and References to People incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995) assumes that a list of attributes of the discourse entities is readily available and that attributes that rule out the most distractors are added to the referring expression until its interpretation contains only the intended referent.",
        "Subsequent work on referring expression generation has (a) expanded the logical framework to allow reference by negation (the dog that is not black) and references to multiple entities (the brown or black dogs) (van Deemter 2002; Gatt and Van Deemter 2007), (b) explored different search algorithms for finding a minimal description (e.g., Horacek 2003), and (c) offered different representation frameworks such as graph theory (Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg 2003) or reference domain theory (Denis 2010) as alternatives for representing referring characteristics.",
        "This body of research assumes a limited domain where the semantics of attributes and their allowed values can be formalized, though semantic representations and inference mechanisms are getting increasingly sophisticated (e.g., the use of description logic: Areces, Koller, and Striegnitz 2008; Ren, van Deemter, and Pan 2010).",
        "In contrast, Siddharthan and Copestake (2004) consider open-domain generation of referring expressions in a regeneration task (text simplification); they take a different approach, approximating the hand-coded domainknowledge of earlier systems with a measure of relatedness for attribute-values that is derived from WordNet synonym and antonym links.",
        "2.2.3 Recent Trends: Data Collection and Evaluations.",
        "There is now increasing awareness that factors other than conciseness are important when planning referring expressions and that considerable variation exists between humans generating referring expressions in similar contexts.",
        "Recent evaluation exercises such as the TUNA challenge (Gatt, Belz, and Kow 2008) therefore consider metrics other than length of a reference, such as humanness and the time taken by hearers to identify the referent.",
        "In a similar vein, Viethen and Dale (2006) examine how similar references produced by well-known algorithms are to human-produced references, and Dale and Viethen (2009) examine differences in human behavior when generating referring expressions.",
        "There is also growing collaboration between psycholinguists and computational linguists on the topic of generating referring expressions; for instance, the PRE-CogSci workshop (van Deemter et al.",
        "2010).",
        "Recently, several corpora marked for various information status aspects have been made available.",
        "Subsequent studies concerned with predicting givenness status (Nissim 2006; Sridhar et al.",
        "2008), narrow focus (Calhoun 2007; Nenkova and Jurafsky 2007), and rheme and theme distinctions (Postolache, Kruijff-Korbayova, and Kruijff 2005) have not been used for generation or summarization tasks.",
        "Current efforts in the language generation community aim at providing a corpus and evaluation task (the GREC challenge) to address just this issue (Belz and Varges 2007; Belz, Kow, and Viethen 2009).",
        "The GREC-2.0 corpus, extracted from Wikipedia articles and annotated for the task of referring expression generation for both first and subsequent mentions of the main subject of the article, consists of 2,000 texts in five different domains (cities, countries, rivers, people, and mountains).",
        "The more recent GREC-People corpus consists of 1,000 texts in just one domain (people) but references to all people mentioned in a text have been annotated.",
        "The GREC challenges require systems to pick the most appropriate reference in context from a list of all references in the document and several defaults, including pronouns, common-noun references, elided reference, and standardized versions of names.",
        "By selecting encyclopedic articles about specific referents, this corpus contains large numbers of subsequent references, and in general, the emphasis has been to model the form of subsequent references to named entities in longer texts.",
        "Discourse-new vs. discourse-old is the only information status distinction that participating systems model, with other features derived from lexical and syntactic context; for instance, Greenbacker and McCoy (2009) consider subjecthood, parallelism, recency, and ambiguity.",

        "Information status distinctions are not normally used in work on generating referring expressions, with a few notable exceptions.",
        "Krahmer and Theune (2002) show that the relative salience of discourse entities can be taken into account to produce less-informative descriptions (including fewer attributes than those necessary to uniquely identify the referent using a discourse model that does not incorporate salience).",
        "In contrast, Jordan and Walker (2005) show that, in task-oriented dialogs, over-specified references (including more attributes than needed to uniquely identify the intended referent) are more likely for certain dialog states and communicative goals.",
        "Some participating teams in the GREC challenges use the discourse-new vs. discourse-old distinction as a feature to help select the most likely reference in context.",

        "Our research both provides a characterization of references to people in the news genre through empirical analysis and uses that characterization to develop a model for generating references to people in news summaries that is based on automatically inferred information status distinctions.",
        "Because summarization takes its content from input full text articles, one contribution of our work is the development of a statistical model for inferring such distinctions from news reports, without requiring manual annotation.",
        "We have shown how this model can then be used to generate appropriate references, including semantic content selection (inclusion of name, role, and affiliation attributes) and realization choices (use of pre-or post-modification).",
        "References to people have very different properties from other kinds of referring expressions (e.g., common noun references to objects).",
        "Research on the generation of referring expressions from semantic representations is based on the notion of selecting attributes that distinguish the object from others; in contrast, discourse-new references to people often contain attributes in addition to the name, and yet the name alone would be a distinguishing attribute.",
        "In this article, we have conducted corpus-based studies to provide answers to how and when attributes are used in references to people in the news genre.",
        "Our study characterizes the differences in discourse-new and discourse-old references, identifies the attributes typically used in discourse-new references to people, and provides evidence that information status distinctions (global salience and familiarity) can determine when people are named in summaries and when additional attributes such as role and affiliation are needed.",
        "These information status distinctions are important when generating summaries of news, as they help determine both what to say and how to say it.",
        "However, using these distinctions for summarization requires inferring information from unrestricted news.",
        "We have shown that the hearer-old/hearer-new and major/minor distinctions can be inferred reliably using features derived from the lexical and syntactic forms and frequencies of references in the news reports.",
        "These acquired distinctions are useful for determining which characters to name in summaries, which characters to further describe or elaborate on, and the forms that any descriptions should take.",
        "Finally, we have reported an evaluation of the effect of reference rewriting on extractive summaries, demonstrating that our rewrites improve coherence and are generally preferred by readers.",
