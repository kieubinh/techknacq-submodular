        "In the last decade, the field of statistical machine translation has shifted from generating sentences word by word to systems that recycle whole fragments of training examples, expressed as translation rules.",
        "This general paradigm was first pursued using contiguous phrases (Och et al., 1999; Koehn et al., 2003), and has since been generalized to a wide variety of hierarchical and syntactic formalisms.",
        "The training stage of statistical systems focuses primarily on discovering translation rules in parallel corpora.",
        "Most systems discover translation rules via a two-stage pipeline: a parallel corpus is aligned at the word level, and then a second procedure extracts fragment-level rules from word-aligned sentence pairs.",
        "This paper offers a model-based alternative to phrasal rule extraction, which merges this two-stage pipeline into a single step.",
        "We present a discriminative model that directly predicts which set of phrasal translation rules should be extracted from a sentence pair.",
        "Our model predicts extraction sets: combinatorial objects that include the set of all overlapping phrasal translation rules consistent with an underlying word-level alignment.",
        "This approach provides additional discriminative power relative to word aligners because extraction sets are scored based on the phrasal rules they contain in addition to word-to-word alignment links.",
        "Moreover, the structure of our model directly reflects the purpose of alignment models in general, which is to discover translation rules.",
        "We address several challenges to training and applying an extraction set model.",
        "First, we would like to leverage existing word-level alignment resources.",
        "To do so, we define a deterministic mapping from word alignments to extraction sets, inspired by existing extraction procedures.",
        "In our mapping, possible alignment links have a precise interpretation that dictates what phrasal translation rules can be extracted from a sentence pair.",
        "This mapping allows us to train with existing annotated data sets and use the predictions from word-level aligners as features in our extraction set model.",
        "Second, our model solves a structured prediction problem, and the choice of loss function during training affects model performance.",
        "We optimize for a phrase-level F-measure in order to focus learning on the task of predicting phrasal rules rather than word alignment links.",
        "Third, our discriminative approach requires that we perform inference in the space of extraction sets.",
        "Our model does not factor over disjoint word-to-word links or minimal phrase pairs, and so existing inference procedures do not directly apply.",
        "However, we show that the dynamic program for a block ITG aligner can be augmented to score extraction sets that are indexed by underlying ITG word alignments (Wu, 1997).",
        "We also describe a",
        "Figure 1: A word alignment A (shaded grid cells) defines projections a(ej) and a(fj), shown as dotted lines for each word in each sentence.",
        "The extraction set R3 (A) includes all bispans licensed by these projections, shown as rounded rectangles.",
        "coarse-to-fine inference approach that allows us to scale our method to long sentences.",
        "Our extraction set model outperforms both unsupervised and supervised word aligners at predicting word alignments and extraction sets.",
        "We also demonstrate that extraction sets are useful for end-to-end machine translation.",
        "Our model improves translation quality relative to state-of-the-art Chinese-to-English baselines across two publicly available systems, providing total BLEU improvements of 1.2 in Moses, a phrase-based system, and 1.4 in a Joshua, a hierarchical system (Koehn et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009)"

        "At the intersection of these lines of work, discriminative ITG models have also been proposed, including one-to-one alignment models (Cherry and Lin, 2006) and block models (Haghighi et al., 2009).",

        "Our approach differs in two ways.",
        "First, their approach is tightly coupled to the input alignments, while we perform a full search over the space of ITG alignments.",
        "Also, their approach uses greedy search, while our search is optimal aside from pruning and beaming.",
        "Despite these differences, their strong results reinforce our claim that phraselevel information is useful for alignment."
